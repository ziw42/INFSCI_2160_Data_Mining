# DM-hw03-starter

This contains the starter code for assignment hw03 (data and sample code included). You should extend `hw03-template.Rmd` with your answers into `hw03.Rmd` and `hw03.html` and commit the two files to your own assignment repository. Finally, follow the homework how-to guide to publish your RMarkdown note and enter the perview-able URL in the Canvas assignment entry.
