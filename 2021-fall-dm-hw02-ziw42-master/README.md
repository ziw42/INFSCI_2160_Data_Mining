# DM-hw02-starter
This contains the starter code for assignment hw02 (data included). You should extend `hw02-template.Rmd` with your answers into `hw02.Rmd` and `hw02.html` and commit the two files to your own assignment repository. Finally, follow the homework how-to guide to publish your RMarkdown note and enter the perview-able URL in the Canvas assignment entry.
