4 by this AGREEMENT); and attending the annual State CLEAT conference, the

11 calendar year, the CITY will contribute 7,000 hours of Association Business Leave (ABL) to a
12 pool of leave time which may be used in accordance with this Article. The CITY will track
13 deductions from the pool as ABL is used. 14
15 b) Any pool hours remaining at the end of a calendar year will remain in the pool to be
16 utilized in the following year. Hours of leave in the pool shall never have any cash or surrender
17 value.
18
19	Section 3. Use of Association Business Leave
20
21	a) ASSOCIATION President 22
23 (1) The ASSOCIATION President may use ABL for any lawful activity consistent with
24 the ASSOCIATION'S purposes, except as specifically prohibited by this AGREEMENT. 25
26 (2) The ASSOCIATION President may be permitted up to 2080 hours of ABL per
27 year. Use of ABL by the ASSOCIATION President may be denied or revoked only in the event
28 of an emergency situation. The ASSOCIATION President will be returned to ABL status after
29 the emergency situation ends. 30
31	b) ASSOCIATION Board Members and Committee Chairs 32
33 (1) ASSOCIATION Board Members and Committee Chairs may use ABL to conduct
34 ASSOCIATION Business as authorized in this Section. Board Members and Committee Chairs
35 may also use ABL for special events that support the mission of the Department or the
36 ASSOCIATION, but do not otherwise violate the terms of this Article. The practice of
37 addressing cadet classes twice during cadet training, with approval of the time and content by the
38 Chief, shall continue through the duration of this AGREEMENT. Such time spent addressing
39 cadet classes shall be deducted from the Pool. This provision does not exclude the Chief from
40 approving other individuals or groups to address cadet classes at his/her discretion, including
41 employee representative groups with current dues check off, but excluding groups that seek to
42 represent Officers regarding wages, hours and other conditions of employment. 43
44 (2) ASSOCIATION Board Members and each of the standing Committee Chairs may
45 each be authorized to utilize up to three hundred (300) hours of ABL from the Pool during the
46 year.

1
2 (3) Subject to the Chief's operational control and approval, two (2) Board Members or
3 Committee Chairs may be authorized to use more than three hundred (300) hours of ABL from
4 the Pool during the year. No more than one-half (1/2) of the hours specified in this Subsection
5	may be utilized for legislative and/or political activities as limited by Section 4. If ABL for such
6 Board Members(s) or Committee Chair(s) is revoked for any reason other than an emergency
7 situation, the ASSOCIATION President may meet with the Deputy City Manager or the
8 Assistant City Manager over public safety to review such action. The timeline for filing a
 9 grievance, if any, shall be tolled until such review has been completed. 10
11	c) ASSOCIATION Members 12
13 The ASSOCIATION may request approval for the use of additional ABL for
14 ASSOCIATION members. Any use of additional ABL will be solely at the Chief's discretion. 15
16	d) Accounting for ABL 17
18 All Officers shall account for all ABL taken through the Chief's office, and such time
19 shall be subtracted from the Association Leave Pool. There shall be no entitlement for overtime
20 pay for any hours worked on ABL. 21
22	e) Officer Conduct While on ABL 23
24 While on ABL, all Officers shall abide by the policies, rules, regulations, procedures, and
25 directives of the Austin Police Department. ABL may be revoked for violations of such policies,
26 including but not limited to acts that bring discredit to the Department or to the CITY, that tend
27 to adversely affect the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Department, or improperly
28 damage or impair the reputation of the Department.	The CITY recognizes the
29 ASSOCIATION'S prerogative to publically express interests related to the wages, rates of pay,
30 hours of employment, or conditions of work affecting the members of the ASSOCIATION. The
31 CITY further recognizes that from time to time, the interests of the ASSOCIATION may not be
32 shared by the Department or CITY. Expression of such interests in a manner consistent with the
33 philosophy and values of the Department will not be considered to be a violation of this
34 Subsection.
35
36	f) Temporary Vacancy 37
38 (1) In his or her sole discretion, the Chief of Police may determine that the continuous
39 absence from duty of more than three months due to the usage of ABL creates a vacancy in the
40 affected Officer's rank, but shall not expand the size of the classified service. When the Officer
41 whose absence created the vacancy returns to active duty, thus creating a surplus in his/her rank,
42 the last person promoted to that rank will be demoted to the next lower classification and placed
43 on a reinstatement list, with such rights as prescribed by this Article. 44
45 (2) The same result applies to all other promotions in lower ranks which resulted from
46 the first promotion and subsequent demotion.

1
2 (3) There shall be only one reinstatement list for each rank for persons demoted by
3 virtue of this Section. Any person placed on the reinstatement list shall remain on the list
4 indefinitely. Persons on the list shall be entitled to reinstatement to the rank from which they
5 were demoted in the same order as the demotion occurred. This results in the last demoted at that
6 rank being the first reinstated. Reinstatements must occur off of the reinstatement list for that
7 rank before any promotions from a promotional eligibility list. Until such reinstatements occur
8 and the reinstatement list is exhausted, there shall be no "vacancy" created at that rank for the
 9 purpose of any promotional eligibility list. 10
11	Section 4.  Use of ABL for Legislative/Political Activities
12
13 a) It is specifically understood and agreed that ABL shall not be utilized for legislative
14 and/or political activities at the State or National level, unless they relate to the wages, rates of
15 pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work affecting the members of the ASSOCIATION.
16 At the local level, the use of ABL for legislative and/or political activities shall be limited to
17 raising concerns regarding officer safety. ABL shall not be utilized for legislative and/or
18 political activities related to any election of public officials or City Charter amendments. ABL
19 shall not be utilized for legislative and/or political activities that are sponsored or supported by
20 the ASSOCIATION'S Political Action Committee(s).
21
22 b) It is specifically understood and agreed that no ABL shall be utilized for legislative
23 and/or political activities at the local, state, or national level that are contrary to the CITY's
24 adopted legislative program. No ABL shall be utilized for activities prohibited by Section
25 143.086 of Chapter 143 or by the Texas Ethics Commission. Nothing contained in this
26 Subsection is intended to prohibit an Officer from using vacation time to engage in legislative
27 and/or political activities. 28
29	Section 5. Request for ABL
30
31 All Association Business Leave will be requested in writing to and approved by the
32 ASSOCIATION President, and submitted in advance for final approval by the Chief in
33 accordance with this Article. The Chief may waive the requirement that the request and approval
34 be in writing. Requests for use of ABL shall be made as far in advance as is practicable. 35
36	Section 6. Effect of Contract Expiration
37

34 Section 5. Written Examination for Promotion to the Ranks of Corporal/ Detective,
35 Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Commander
36
37 All candidates for the ranks of Corporal/Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Commander
38 shall first take a written examination. The maximum score for the written examination shall be
39 one hundred (100) points. The written examination shall consist of questions relating to the
40 duties of the rank to be filled, as contained in reading material selected by the Chief of Police.

43 make a reasonable effort to have the written examination validated. The examination may be
44 validated before or after the examination is given. Prior to being administered, the finalized
45 examination shall be kept in a safe and secure manner. 46

1 The CITY shall make reasonable efforts to provide a six (6) month study time window prior
2 to promotional examinations, but it is recognized that expiration or exhaustion of a list may
3 necessitate an earlier examination. 4
5 Section 6.	Assessment Center Process for Promotion to the Ranks of Sergeant,
6 Lieutenant or Commander
7
8 a) Officers who pass the Sergeant's, Lieutenant's or Commander's written promotional
9 examination with a score of seventy percent (70%) or higher will proceed to the next step of the
10 examination process, which is an Assessment Center (unless a Technical Skills Evaluation is
11 used for the rank of Sergeant). 12
13 b) Prior to the written test being administered, the Chief shall establish assessment criteria
14 based on job content and responsibility. The Director of Civil Service will generate a list of
15 consultants, and will review that list with the Chief, who will approve the list. The Chief shall
16 also appoint three (3) members to serve on an Assessment Center Review Committee (ACRC),
17 plus one (1) alternate. The ASSOCIATION shall also select three (3) individuals to serve on the
18 ACRC and one (1) alternate. All ACRC members shall be selected from the tested rank or
19 above. The ACRC shall meet and consider the list of consultants approved by the Chief and
20 recommend an Assessment Center Consultant from the list, subject to Council approval,
21 pursuant to City purchasing policies and procedures. 22
23 c) After the Assessment Center Consultant has been selected, the Consultant will orient the
24 ACRC. The Consultant will confer with both the Chief and the ACRC on the needs or issues
25 affecting the design of the Assessment Center. Any input from the ASSOCIATION will be
26 summarized by the ACRC and made available to anyone who requests it. The Consultant shall
27 make all final decisions concerning the design and implementation of the Assessment Center. 28
29	d) The consultant will design the Assessment Center from among the following exercises: 30
31 In-Basket
32 Problem Solving/Analysis
33 Written and Oral Resumes/Structured Interviews
34 Role-Playing
35 Memo/Report Writing
36 Oral Presentation/Plan Preparation
37 Staff Meeting
38 Special Event/Operations 39
40 The consultant is not required to utilize all of the exercises, but may select the exercises or
41 combine the listed exercises into one or more exercises that are best suited for the particular
42 rank.
43
44	e) The Consultant also selects the assessors, who shall meet the following criteria: 45

1 (1) Active duty, sworn officers of similar rank to the promotion, or above, from cities
2 with a population of 200,000 or greater; 3
4(2)Shall not reside in Austin;56(3)Shall not be related to any candidates for promotion;78(4)Shall not be known to, beyond mere acquaintance, any candidates for promotion;910(5)Shall have two (2) years of experience in the promoted or equivalent rank; and1112(6)Shall not be a current or former employee of the City of Austin.1314 f) The Consultant shall conduct an orientation for candidates prior to administering the
15 Assessment Center. If the Consultant deems the orientation mandatory, all candidates must
16 attend in order to participate. If the consultant deems orientation to be mandatory, then at least
17 two (2) orientations shall be scheduled with one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If a
18 mandatory orientation is scheduled during an Officer's work time, he/she will be permitted to
19 attend.
20
21 g) The assessors selected by the Consultant will assess the candidates for the rank. The
22 assessors shall award up to one hundred (100) points to each candidate participating in the
23 assessment center. The assessment sessions will be videotaped, and candidates may review their
24 own session pursuant to procedures established by the Civil Service Director, provided that
25 candidates are given up to four (4) hours, which may be provided in smaller increments of time,
26 to review their assessment session. The Civil Service Director shall make blocks of time
27 available for Officers to review examination results from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and, in addition,
28 shall provide at least two (2) evening options until 10:00 p.m. However, the Civil Service
29 Director will not provide these time periods and the required staff unless the times are reserved
30 in advance. Examination reviews will be conducted on the Officer's off-duty time. Copies of
31 the videotapes will not be given to the candidate. Nothing in the assessment center process may
32 be appealed either to the Police Civil Service Commission, hearing examiner, or the District
33 Court.
34
35 h) Eligible Officers who do not participate in the Assessment Center process or the
36 Technical Skills Evaluation process without legitimate excuse shall be removed from the
37 eligibility list.
38
39 Section 7.  Eligibility Lists for the Ranks of Corporal/Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, and
40 Commander
41
42 a) All promotional eligibility lists created under this Article shall be constructed, with the
43 highest total score being ranked number one and descending in numerical order. 44
45 b) All promotional eligibility lists shall be valid for twenty-four (24) months from the date
46 the final eligibility list is initially posted. In the event of any occurrence which results in a

1 change to the eligibility list, the changed list shall be effective on the day the original list was
2 effective, even after termination of this AGREEMENT. In the event of a clerical or electronic
3 error in computing the test scores, the expiration date of any promotional examination eligibility
4 list may be amended by written agreement between the President of the ASSOCIATION and the
5 City Manager.
6
7 c) If a written promotional examination for a rank has been given prior to the expiration of
8 this AGREEMENT, the promotional process for that rank may continue to completion, the
9 expiration of this AGREEMENT notwithstanding, and the resulting eligibility list shall have a
10 life of twenty-four (24) months from the date the final eligibility list is initially posted. In the
11 event of any occurrence which results in a change to the eligibility list, the changed list shall be
12 effective on the day the original list was effective, even after termination of this AGREEMENT. 13
14	Section 8. Appeals Criteria Committee
15
16 An Appeals Criteria Committee (ACC) will determine the criteria for what may be appealed
17 to the Police Civil Service Commission following all written promotional examinations. The
18 ACC shall establish appeal criteria which will be used for all written examinations held during
19 the term of this AGREEMENT. The ACC, composed of seven (7) individuals, shall be
20 appointed as follows:
21
22 a) Three (3) members appointed by ASSOCIATION, each having taken at least one (1)
23 promotional exam;
24
25 b) Two (2) members appointed by the Chief of Police, each having taken at least one (1)
26 promotional exam;
27
28	c) One (1) member appointed by the Director of Civil Service ; and 29
30	d) One (1) member appointed by the Chair of the Police Civil Service Commission. 31
32 A simple majority of the ACC shall approve the criteria. The Chief may reconvene the ACC
33 if, after an eligibility list has been established, it appears that clarification or modification of the
34 criteria is warranted. The criteria approved by the ACC shall not be appealable to the Police
35 Civil Service Commission, a hearing examiner, or to District Court. 36
37	Section 9. Appeal Process After Written Examination
38
39 Within 72 hours after a promotional examination is held, the Commission shall post the
40 individual raw scores by PID numbers only on a bulletin board located in the main lobby of the
41 city hall. Any Officer who has taken a written promotional examination may, within seven (7)
42 business days of the posting of the written promotional exam results, review his/her examination
43 results. The process shall be established by the Director of Civil Service; provided, however,
44 that each Officer who has taken a promotional examination may have up to four (4) hours to
45 review his/her examination, write, and submit the appeal, if any, which must be based on the
46 appeal criteria approved by the ACC. Once an appeal is filed, it shall be assigned a number and

1 processed anonymously. The Officer may obtain a copy of his or her appeal. The Civil Service
2 Director shall make blocks of time available for Officers to review examination results from 8:00
3 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and, in addition, shall provide at least two (2) evening options until 10:00 p.m.
4 However, the Civil Service Director will not provide these time periods and the required staff
5 unless the times are reserved in advance. Examination reviews will be conducted on the
6 Officer's off-duty time. There will be no appeal to the Civil Service Commission, a hearing
7 examiner, or to the District Court of any facet of the examination review process. 8
9	Section 10. Review by Employee Review Committee
10
11 An Employee Review Committee (ERC) will be appointed to screen written examination
12 appeals to the Civil Service Commission, applying the criteria established by the ACC to
13 determine which appeals should be rejected because they do not meet the criteria. Assuring for
14 diversity as is practical and possible the ERC shall be comprised of five (5) members as follows: 15
16 a) Four (4) officers of the rank of the promotional exam or higher, two (2) each appointed
17 by the ASSOCIATION and the Chief of Police; and 18
19	b) One (1) member appointed by the Director of Civil Service. 20
21 Appeals may advance from the ERC to the Civil Service Commission by a vote of a simple
22 majority of the ERC. The ERC will not make any statement, assertion, or recommendation
23 regarding the validity of an appeal or subsequent Civil Service Commission action. There will
24 be no State District Court appeal of the ERC's examination appeal determinations or from the
25 Police Civil Service Commission's written examination appeal decisions, except an appeal
26 alleging the CITY's failure to validate the written examination. 27
28	Section 11. Time Limit to Fill Vacant Positions
29
30 It is expressly understood and agreed that the provisions in Chapter 143.036(d) and (e) and
31 143.014(f) of the Local Government Code prescribing time limits for filling vacancies at the rank
32 of Sergeant or above shall be expanded to one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days from the
33 date the vacancy occurs during the term of this AGREEMENT. 34
35	Section 12. Committee on the Assessment Center Process
36
37 The CITY and the ASSOCIATION shall each appoint two (2) persons to a committee that
38 shall schedule a meeting with the participants in each Assessment Center process to discuss the
39 strengths and weaknesses perceived by the participants, after completion of the process. The
40 Committee may recommend changes in the procedures to the Chief. 41
42	Section 13. Military Promotions/Demotions
43
44 The following changes are made to Sections 143.036 and 143.072 of the Texas Local
45 Government Code: 46

1 a) When an Officer is promoted as the result of a vacancy created by a military leave of
2 absence, when the Officer on military leave returns to active duty in the Department, the person
3 who filled the most recent vacancy at that rank shall be the one who is demoted to the next
4 lowest classification and placed on a reinstatement list, with such rights as prescribed in this
5 Article. 6
7 b) The same result applies to all other promotions in lower ranks which resulted from the
8 first promotion and subsequent demotion. 9
10 c) All other provisions of Sections 143.036 and 143.072 not specifically changed by this
11 AGREEMENT shall remain in effect. 12
13	Section 14. Vacancy Created by Indefinite Suspension
14
15 a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Article or any provision in Local Government
16 Code Chapter 143, an indefinite suspension of an Officer (despite any pending appeal) shall
17 create a vacancy, but shall not expand the size of the classified service. In the event that an
18 indefinite suspension is overturned on appeal and the Officer is reinstated to active duty in the
19 Department, the person who filled the most recent vacancy at that rank shall be the one who is
20 demoted to the next lowest classification and placed on a reinstatement list, with such rights as
21 prescribed in this Article. 22
23 b) The same result applies to all other promotions in lower ranks which resulted from the
24 first promotion and subsequent demotion. 25
26	Section 15. Reinstatement List
27
28 a) There shall be only one reinstatement list for each rank for persons demoted by virtue of
29 Sections 13 and 14 of this Article. 30
31	b) Any person placed on the reinstatement list shall remain on the list indefinitely. 32
33 c) Persons on the list shall be entitled to reinstatement to the rank from which they were
34 demoted in the same order as the demotion occurred. This results in the last demoted at that rank
35 being the first reinstated. Reinstatements must occur off of the reinstatement list for that rank
36 before any promotions from a promotional eligibility list. Until such reinstatements occur and
37 the reinstatement list is exhausted, there shall be no "vacancy" created at that rank for the
38 purpose of any promotional eligibility list. 39
40 d) Time spent on a reinstatement list shall not be considered a break in service for civil
41 service purposes, including, but not limited to eligibility for future promotional examinations. 42
43	Section 16. Effect of Contract Expiration
44
45 The provisions of this Article shall remain in full force and effect after expiration of this
46 AGREEMENT as to:

1
2	a) All promotional eligibility lists created during this AGREEMENT; and 3
4	b) All reinstatement lists created pursuant to this Article. 5

14 experienced police officers and Cadets for the Department's regular Training Academy program,
15 hereby agrees to the deviations from Chapter 143 hiring procedures specifically authorized by

25 limited to, information on personal history, criminal history, driving record and age. The
26 information submitted shall be used by the Police Department to determine whether the applicant
27 meets the minimum qualifications to proceed to the testing phase of the process. 28
29 b) The Police Chief shall establish the eligibility requirements for applicants for the position

38
39 a) The Police Chief will develop and implement the screening and testing procedures used
40 to determine whether an applicant will be offered a position as a police cadet in a Police
41 Academy class. The screening and testing procedures will include, at a minimum, a structured
42 Oral Interview Board and a background investigation. Nothing in this AGREEMENT or in
43 Chapter 143 will restrict the nature of the tests administered to applicants or the procedures used
44 to administer those tests. 45
46	b) Applicants who successfully complete all of the screening and testing procedures will be

1	placed on an eligibility list per Department policy or procedure. Applicants on the eligibility list
2	may be offered a position as police cadet in any upcoming Police Academy class. 3
4 c) Each eligibility list created as a result of the process described in this Section shall
5 remain effective for twenty-four (24) months after certification by the Civil Service Commission. 6
7	Section 4. Police Internship Program
8
9 The Department may create and implement a Police Internship Program for individuals who

11 must pass the same screening and testing procedures as applicants for the position of Police
12 Cadet, either at the beginning or at the end of their participation in the Program. The duration of
13 the Police Internship Program will be at least the equivalent of a college semester. Any intern
14 who successfully completes the Police Internship Program shall be placed at the top of the
15 current or next eligibility list for hire as a Police Cadet. Up to thirty-eight percent (38%) of each
16 Police Academy class may consist of interns who successfully completed the Police Internship
17 Program.
18
19	Section 5. Effect on Present Cadet Classes
20
21 It is specifically understood and agreed that the hiring process set out in this AGREEMENT

28 commission and shall end at the expiration of fifteen (15) months. The probationary period of
29 any cadet that already holds a commission prior to entering the police academy shall begin on the
30 date the officer receives their first assignment after successful completion of the academy, and
31 shall end at the expiration of fifteen (15) months. However, any leave taken by a probationary
32 police officer during this probationary time period, including but not limited to injury leave,
33 FMLA leave, sick leave, shall extend this probationary period by the length of the leave taken.
34 (Approved vacation leave other than FMLA will not so extend the probationary period.) 35

41 may not need to attend the Department's regular Training Academy program.
42
43	Section 2. Eligibility Requirements
44
45 a) The Chief of Police shall establish the eligibility requirements for applicants for the
46 Modified Hiring Process. The requirements need not be the same as those established by
47 Chapter 143 or those applicable to applicants for the position of Cadet in the Department's

1 regular Training Academy. The requirements may be modified by the Chief of Police, but shall
2 include at least the following:

15	(3) Each applicant will be subject to a background investigation. 16
17 b) The Chief of Police or his designee may, at his or her sole discretion, deny the application
18 of any applicant for the Modified Hiring Process and may determine whether a particular
19 applicant meets the eligibility requirements. 20
21 c) Once the hiring process for a modified class has been identified, the CITY will provide
22 the process to the ASSOCIATION prior to accepting applications. The CITY agrees not to
23 change the hiring process for that hiring cycle unless a court, the DOJ, the EEOC/TWCCRD, or
24 a third party vendor that participated in designing the process, determines that the process
25 outcome is unlawful under Title VII or Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. 26
27	Section 3. Selection and Placement
28
29 a) The Chief of Police shall establish the selection criteria and procedures for the Modified
30 Hiring Process, which need not be the same as those established by Chapter 143 or those
31 applicable to applicants for the position of Cadet in the Department's regular Training Academy.
32 Applicants who meet the selection criteria and procedures may be hired without being placed on
33 an eligibility list.
34
35 b) Upon hire, the applicant will be placed in the position of "Cadet Senior," regardless of
36 any rank or position the officer previously held in another law enforcement agency, to the same
37 extent as if they had been hired under the processes prescribed by Chapter 143. Each Cadet
38 Senior must complete a Modified Training Academy and probationary period. 39

1 months following completion of the Modified Training Academy, but not to exceed the
2 probationary period for officers hired through the Department's regular hiring process.
3
4	Section 5. Civil Service Status
5
6 a) A Cadet Senior who successfully completes the Modified Training Academy will be
7 placed in the Civil Service classification of Police Officer and automatically becomes a full-
8 fledged Civil Service employee and has full Civil Service protection, subject to successfully
9 completing probation. Until completion of probation, each officer hired through this Modified
10 Hiring Process is an at-will employee who may be discharged by the Chief of Police at any time,
11 without right of appeal. 12
13 b) Until completion of probation, an Officer hired through the Modified Hiring Process is
14 excluded from the coverage of Articles 17 and 18 and cannot file grievances pursuant to Article

17	Section 6. Pay and Seniority
18
19 a) The Chief of Police may determine the pay rate for each Cadet Senior during the
20 Modified Training Academy. Upon completion of the Academy, the Chief of Police may
21 determine the pay rate for each Police Officer hired through this Modified Hiring Process. Any
22 pay rate established by the Chief shall not exceed that of an Officer with two years' experience
23 in the Austin Police Department. 24
25 b) Regardless of the pay rate established for each Cadet Senior, seniority for purposes of
26 longevity pay shall begin when the Officer successfully completes the Modified Training
27 Academy. 28
29	Section 7. Promotional Eligibility
30
31 Officers hired through the Modified Hiring Process must meet the same promotional
32 eligibility requirements as Austin Police Department Officers hired through the Department's

35	Section 8. Implementation
36
37 The Modified Hiring Process described by this Article may be used at any time, for any
38 number of applicants, as authorized by the Chief of Police. 39
40	Part D. Additional Provisions
41
42	Section 1. Benefit of the Bargain
43
44 The ASSOCIATION and the CITY share the goal of recruiting and hiring the most qualified
45 applicants to become Austin Police Officers. The ASSOCIATION acknowledges the significant
46 effort and skill of the Department's Recruiting Unit in trying to meet this goal, but recognize that

1 the Department needs to be able to adjust hiring procedures as necessary, without having to wait
2 until the next Meet & Confer negotiation process. The parties agree that the degree of flexibility
3 incorporated into this Article is of benefit to both parties and that this AGREEMENT would not
4 have been reached without the flexibility provided by this Article. 5
6	Section 2. Effect of Contract Expiration
7
8 The provisions of this Article shall remain in full force and effect after expiration of this
9 Agreement as to:
10
11 a) Any hiring process which has been commenced  in substantial  reliance upon the

14 b) The length of the "at will" probationary period for individuals in that status prior to the
15 expirations of this AGREEMENT; 16
17 c) Any eligibility list created under the terms of this Article will remain in effect for 24
18 months, notwithstanding the expiration of this AGREEMENT; 19

26 ARTICLE 15
27 DRUG TESTING
28
29	Section 1.  Commitment to an Effective Drug Interdiction Program
30
31 The CITY and the ASSOCIATION agree that Officers may be called upon in hazardous
32 situations without warning, and that it is imperative to the interest of the Officers and the public
33 to ensure that Officers are not substance impaired. In order to further their joint interest in
34 protecting Officers and the public, the CITY and the ASSOCIATION agree to mandatory drug
35 testing as described in this section. The CITY and the ASSOCIATION have a mutual interest in
36 ensuring that drug impaired Officers do not perform law enforcement duties. The CITY and the
37 ASSOCIATION are committed to the principle that the mandatory drug testing policy for
38 Officers is designed and shall be administered to result in disciplinary action only against those
39 Officers who have violated the Police Department's rules, regulations, policies and procedures. 40
41	Section 2. Random Testing
42
43 One hundred percent (100%) of Officers at all ranks, including the Chief, shall be susceptible
44 to mandatory testing for illegal drugs and controlled substances during each calendar year on a
45 fair and impartial statistical basis at the CITY's expense. The fair and impartial statistical basis
46 (in which each Officer has an equal chance of being selected during a calendar year) shall be by

1 a non-discriminatory computerized program operated and certified as non-discriminatory by an
2 independent firm hired by the CITY, and the Officer shall be tested upon being selected by the
3 computer.
4
5 Upon notice of selection for random testing, any Officer shall provide a urine sample in
6 accordance with the policy or protocol established by the testing laboratory. Failure to provide a
7 sample shall be equivalent to insubordination and may be the basis for suspension or indefinite
8 suspension.
9
10	Section 3. Assurance of Accurate Results
11
12 Officers shall have the right to request that their urine sample be stored in case of legal
13 disputes. The urine sample will be submitted to the designated testing facility where a sample
14 will be maintained for the period of one year. Officers may, at their own expense, request to
15 have a test administered at an approved physician's office accompanied by the testing personnel
16 provided such testing is administered within eight (8) hours after notification by the Chief. Drug
17 testing shall consist of a two-step procedure:
18
19 1. Initial screening test.
20 2. Confirmation test. 21
22 Should a confirmation test be required, the test procedure will be technologically different
23 and more sensitive than the initial screening test. Officers shall be provided with a notice of the
24 result and may obtain a copy of the actual laboratory result upon request to the Lieutenant
25 assigned responsibility as Drug Testing Coordinator. 26
27 The CITY and the ASSOCIATION agree that only an appropriately certified laboratory
28 should conduct drug testing. The laboratory selected shall be experienced and capable of quality
29 control documentation, chain of custody and have a demonstrated technical expertise and
30 proficiency in urine analysis and shall comply with all requirements of an appropriately certified
31 laboratory. The CITY shall require any laboratory selected for collecting samples to conduct a
32 background investigation on those laboratory personnel involved in the collecting or handling of
33 an unsealed sample. In addition, the CITY shall require any laboratory involved in collecting
34 samples to use only employees who have not been arrested by Officers of the Austin Police
35 Department or convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime involving dishonest conduct or
36 possession of illegal drugs to be involved in collecting or handling of an unsealed sample
37 collected from an Officer. In the event that the laboratory that collects the initial samples is not
38 the same laboratory that conducts the actual testing of those samples, only the laboratory that
39 collects the initial samples must comply with the background and criminal history provision of
40 this AGREEMENT. Test results shall be inadmissible in any administrative disciplinary hearing
41 if it is determined that the laboratory collecting samples failed to conduct a background
42 investigation on the laboratory personnel involved in collecting or handling the unsealed sample
43 which resulted in a positive test result. 44
45 All records pertaining to the Department-required drug tests shall remain confidential except
46 to the extent used in a disciplinary appeal. Drug test results and records shall be stored in a

1 locked file under the control of the Drug Coordinator, and under the supervision of the Chief,
2 who will maintain original copies submitted by the laboratory. No access to these files shall be
3 allowed without written approval of the Chief. 4
5	Section 4. Testing on Reasonable Suspicion
6
7 Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prohibit the Chief from conducting a drug test on
8 an Officer, or a search of any areas in which the Officer does not have a personal privacy
9 expectation, based upon reasonable suspicion in accordance with the guidelines as set forth in
10 Department policy for such actions. Such actions may be taken upon the agreement of any two
11 supervisors that there is a reasonable basis for a suspicion that:
12
13	a) An Officer is presently using or under the influence of illegal drugs or inhalants; 14
15	b) An Officer has possession of illegal drugs or inhalants; 16
17 c) An Officer has been associated with or involved with others who were using or under the
18 influence of illegal drugs or inhalants, or who were in possession of same, which association or
19 involvement was not authorized or required in connection with any law enforcement duty, under
20 circumstances which reasonably indicate participation or complicity with, or protection of such
21 other individuals; or 22
23 d) Any conduct or situation described in a-c immediately above involving alcohol, while on
24 duty, or which results in on-duty impairment. 25

12	g) Access to Confidential Information 13
14 (1) Panel members shall have full access to all administrative investigative and

18 individual Panel members all IAD case files scheduled for review pursuant to subsection "f (3)"
19 above. Individual Panel members may review the IAD case file for up to eight (8) hours, at the

21 opportunity may occur before the Panel's private session and/or after the Panel's public session

23 the Panel is given a preview of the general nature of the cases that will appear at the next Panel
24 meeting. The focus of the discussion shall not be on the specific facts of any particular case.
25 The purpose of this conference call is so that the Panel members may decide if they need to

27 apply to any confidential information viewed by Panel members during this review opportunity.
28 Panel members shall not copy or remove any portion of the file. The Police Monitor shall be
29 responsible for security of the file. 30
31 (2) In an effort to ensure the Panel has a more complete view of the types of cases the

33 overview of APD activity up to that point in the calendar year. 34
35	h) Private Case Briefing Session 36

25 under this AGREEMENT. 26
27 (3) During any private Panel briefing, the presenter should exercise discretion and omit
28 information from the briefing that the Police Monitor deems to be irrelevant to the citizen's
29 complaint, as well as information of a highly personal nature that would constitute an
30 unwarranted invasion of an individual's personal privacy interests.
31
32 (4) In addition to those individuals involved in briefing the Panel, and the Association
33 Representative, the Assistant Police Monitor, the staff member from the Office of the Police
34 Monitor that is assigned to the case, and a designated attorney from the City Attorney's Office

38	i) Public Session and Comments 39
40 After the Private Session, the Panel shall meet in Public Session to receive public
41 input/communications. During the public session, the Police Monitor shall take precautions to
42 prevent discussion of the facts of the particular case and to prevent the Public Session from being
43 used as a forum to gather evidence, interview witnesses, or otherwise independently investigate a
44 complaint. Any individual who indicates that he has new or additional evidence concerning the
45 particular case shall be referred to the Chief of Police or his designee. The rules that apply to
46 citizen communications with the City Council shall apply to the public session of the Panel

12
13	(2) Private Session:
14
15	If the Complainant articulates relevant privacy or safety concerns, the Police Monitor
16	may allow the complainant to address the Panel in a private session. The Officer who is the
17 subject of the complaint may, but is not required, attend and listen to the address by the
18 complainant, and may also address the Panel. If the complainant is anxious or intimidated by
19 the presence of the Officer, the Panel shall videotape the complainant's address to the Panel, and
20 allow the Officer to view and respond to the taped statement outside the complainant's presence.
21 Other than the complainant and the responding police officer, only those persons authorized to
22 attend the Panel Private case briefing may be present during this private Panel Session. 23
24	k) Deliberations 25

27 review in private session. The Police Monitor and/or the Assistant Police Monitor, the staff
28 member from the Office of the Police Monitor that is assigned to the case, and a designated
29 attorney from the City Attorney's Office may be present during such discussion. No other
30 individual may be present unless, the Panel requests further information; if the Panel does so, the
31 Police Monitor or Assistant Police Monitor, and the IA Commander or Lieutenant, must also be
32 present.
33
34	l) Action and Recommendations 35

4 Chief of Police, subject to the Officer's right of appeal of any discipline imposed as provided by
5 Chapter 143 of the Texas Local Government Code and this AGREEMENT. Neither the OPM
6 employees nor individual members of the Panel shall publicly express agreement or
7 disagreement with the final disciplinary decision of the Chief, other than as set forth in the
8 written recommendation. A deliberate violation of this provision shall be subject to the dispute
9 resolution process set forth in Section 7 of this Article, but a Panel member shall be permanently
10 removed from the Panel upon a violation of this standard. 11
12 (3) Members must attend the meeting and hear the merits of the case in order to vote.

39 regardless of whether discipline is imposed. 40
41 It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that any recommendation and/or
42 report released pursuant to this Section may contain information which would otherwise
43 be made confidential by Section 143.089(g) of the Texas Local Government Code. 44
45 b) The public release of information authorized in this AGREEMENT will be reviewed by
46 the City of Austin Law Department to insure compliance with this AGREEMENT and to

1	determine whether the release of such information may be prohibited by any other law. 2
3	c) Unauthorized Release of Confidential Documents/Information: 4
5 (1) Except as permitted by this AGREEMENT, employees of the OPM and members of
6 the Panel shall not publicly comment on the specifics of pending complaints and investigations
7 prior to a Panel decision. All public comments and communications by the OPM shall be factual
8 and demonstrate impartiality to individual police officers, the Austin Police Department, the
9 Austin Police Association, employees of the City of Austin, residents of the City of Austin, and
10 community groups.
11
12 (2) Should a person participating on a Panel make public statements which, to a
13 reasonable observer, would be perceived to express or demonstrate a position, bias, or
14 prejudgment on the merits of a particular case that is under investigation or subject to review,
15 prior to the completion of the citizen panel process for that case, such person will not be allowed
16 to participate in the review, deliberation, or drafting of recommendations concerning that case.
17 This provision does not prohibit the Panel or an individual Panel member from making generic,
18 non-case related public statements about the Austin Police Department, or from providing
19 information about the process, which does not appear to prejudge the merits, or demonstrate a
20 bias on the case. In the event of a deliberate violation of this standard, the Panel member shall
21 be permanently removed from the Panel as set forth below. 22
23 (3) No public comment or communication (including but not limited to oral or written
24 statements, reports, newsletters, or other materials made, released, published or distributed) by
25 the OPM or Panel members will make reference to or identify an Officer by name, unless such
26 release is then permitted by law, or the Officer's name has become public as a matter of fact by
27 lawful or authorized means, or by the Officer's own release.	Public comments or
28 communications by the OPM and the Panel shall conform to state and federal law and this
29 AGREEMENT regarding confidentiality, and shall not contain information that is confidential or
30 privileged under this AGREEMENT or state, federal or common law. 31
32 (4) All OPM written publications shall be provided to the APD and the APA
33 simultaneously with distribution to the public. 34
35 (5) Any deliberate release of information that is made confidential by law or by this
36 AGREEMENT shall result in the permanent removal of the offending member from the Panel.
37 Any deliberate premature release of information before it may properly be released likewise will
38 result in the permanent removal of the offending member from Panel. 39
40	Section 7. Dispute Resolution
41
42 a) Complaints concerning the conduct of OPM employees shall be filed with the Police
43 Monitor, or if the complaint concerns the personal conduct of the Police Monitor, shall be filed
44 with the City Manager. If not resolved at the first level, a fact finder shall be appointed to review
45 relevant materials and take evidence to reach written findings of fact, which shall be expedited
46 for final resolution within two weeks after appointment. The fact finder shall be appointed by

1 striking an AAA list, if the parties do not otherwise agree on a fact finder. Upon conclusion of
2 the fact finding, and after review and evaluation of the fact finder's report, the Police Monitor (or
3 City Manager if the complaint concerns the personal conduct of the Police Monitor) shall make a
4 decision. The final decision shall be made by the City Manager. 5
6 b) Complaints concerning the conduct of Panel members shall be filed with the City
7 Manager. If a signed complaint is filed alleging specific comments by a Panel member that
8 violate the standards in subparagraph 6(c) above, the Panel's consideration shall be postponed or
9 the particular Panel member shall not participate, until the matter is finally resolved. A
10 complaint may not be based on statements or conduct previously raised and found insufficient
11 for disqualification. Only one of such Panel members may be temporarily disqualified under this
12 provision on a particular case. The City Manager shall promptly determine the complaint. The
13 ASSOCIATION may appeal from the decision of the City Manager through the expedited
14 arbitration process in this AGREEMENT. If two (2) consecutive complaints are found
15 insufficient on a particular Panel member, subsequent complaints on that Panel member shall not
16 result in temporary removal, but upon final determination that there has been a violation, such
17 member shall be subject to permanent removal. Nothing shall prevent the Chief from taking
18 disciplinary action within the statutory time frame, under the provisions of Chapter 143, as
19 modified by this AGREEMENT. 20
21	Section 8. Access to Section 143.089(g) Files
22
23 a) Information concerning the administrative review of complaints against Officers,
24 including but not limited to Internal Affairs Division files and all contents thereof, are intended
25 solely for the Department's use pursuant to Section 143.089(g) of the Texas Local Government
26 Code (the 143.089(g) file). All records of the Police Monitor's Office that relate to individual
27 case investigations and the APD 143.089(g) file, although same are not APD files or records,
28 shall have the same statutory character in the hands of the Police Monitor, and shall not be
29 disclosed by any person, unless otherwise authorized by law or this AGREEMENT. Public
30 access to such information is strictly governed by this AGREEMENT and Texas law. To the
31 extent necessary to perform their duties, individuals involved in the Citizen Oversight process
32 are granted a right of access to the information contained within the 143.089(g) files of Officers
33 to the extent authorized by this AGREEMENT. 34
35 b) Individuals involved in the Citizen Oversight process shall not be provided with
36 information contained within a personnel file, including the 143.089(g) file of an Officer, that is
37 made confidential by a law other than Chapter 143 of the Texas Local Government Code, such
38 as records concerning juveniles, sexual assault victims, and individuals who have tested positive
39 for HIV. All persons who have access to IAD files or investigative information by virtue of this
40 AGREEMENT shall not be provided with access to any records of criminal investigations by the
41 APD unless those materials are a part of the IAD administrative investigation file. 42
43 c) All individuals who have access by virtue of this AGREEMENT to IAD files or
44 investigative information, including the information contained within the 143.089(g) files of
45 Officers, shall be bound to the same extent as the Austin Police Department and the City of
46 Austin to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this AGREEMENT, Chapter 143 of the

1 Texas Local Government Code, and the Texas Public Information Act. All such individuals
2 shall further be bound to the same extent as the Austin Police Department and the City of Austin
3 to respect the rights of individual Police Officers under the Texas Constitution and the Fourth,
4 Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including not revealing information
5 contained in a compelled statement protected by the doctrine set forth in Garrity v. New Jersey, 6	385 U.S. 493 (1967), and Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967).
7
8 d) A breach of the confidentiality provisions of this AGREEMENT and/or Chapter 143 of
 9 the Texas Local Government Code by any individual involved in Citizen Oversight: 10
11	(1) Shall be a basis for removal from office; 12
13 (2) May subject the individual to criminal prosecution for offenses including, but not
14 limited to Abuse of Official Capacity, Official Oppression, Misuse of Official
15 Information, or the Texas Public Information Act; and/or 16
17	(3) May subject the individual to civil liability under applicable State and Federal law. 18
19 e) The confidentiality provisions of this AGREEMENT, Chapter 143 of the Texas Local
20 Government Code, and the Texas Public Information Act, are continuous in nature. All
21 individuals involved in Citizen Oversight are subject to these confidentiality provisions even
22 after their association with the Oversight process has terminated. 23
24 f) Following any review of an alleged violation of the confidentiality provisions of this
25 AGREEMENT, the City Manager's office will provide information about the outcome of that
26 review to any Officer(s) directly affected by the alleged violation. 27
28	Section 9. Use of Evidence from the Citizen Oversight Process in Disciplinary Appeals
29
30 Opinions or recommendations from individuals involved in Citizen Oversight in a particular
31 case may not be used by a party in connection with an appeal of any disciplinary action under the
32 provisions of Chapter 143 of the Texas Local Government Code and this AGREEMENT. No
33 party to an arbitration or Civil Service proceeding may use or subpoena any member of the
34 Citizen Review Panel or the Police Monitor (unless the Police Monitor took the complaint in the
35 relevant case) as a witness at an arbitration or Civil Service proceeding including, but not limited
36 to live or deposition testimony, which concerns their duties or responsibilities in the oversight
37 process or their opinions or recommendations in a particular case. This provision shall not
38 prevent any testimony for evidentiary predicate. 39
40	Section 10. Partial Invalidation and Severance
41
42 In the event that a Court Order, Judgment, Texas Attorney General Opinion, or arbitration
43 decision, which is final and non-appealable, or which is otherwise allowed to take effect, which
44 order, judgment, opinion, or decision holds that the right of access to the information contained
45 within the 143.089(g) files of Officers granted by this Article or the public dissemination of
46 information pursuant to this Article, results in "public information" status under the Texas Public

1 Information Act of the information contained within the 143.089(g) files of an Officer, the
2 provision or provisions resulting in such a change in the status of the 143.089(g) file shall be
3 invalidated and severed from the balance of this AGREEMENT. 4
5	Section 11. Remedies
6
7	a) Benefit of the Bargain 8
9 The CITY expressly retains its right and ability to proceed with the determination of whether
10 or not police misconduct occurred and the authority of the Chief to impose disciplinary action.
11 The ASSOCIATION recognizes the fact that such reservations are essential to this
12 AGREEMENT. No dispute concerning the operation and function of the Police Monitor's
13 Office or the Panel shall impair or delay the process of the Chief's investigation and
14 determination of whether or not police misconduct occurred and the degree of discipline, if any,
15 to impose. This includes internal dispute resolution procedures in this AGREEMENT, any
16 grievance process or arbitration, and any litigation over such issues. In other words, any such
17 dispute resolution processes may proceed, as set forth in this contract or by law, but the
18 disciplinary process may likewise and simultaneously proceed to its conclusion without delay.
19 The statutory time period for the Chief of Police to take disciplinary action against an Officer
20 shall be tolled to the extent of any period in which a court order, injunction, or TRO, obtained by
21 the Officer involved or the ASSOCIATION on behalf of the Officer, halts the Department's
22 investigative or disciplinary process. In no event will the actual time exceed 180 calendar days.
23 The parties agree that the processes in this AGREEMENT, together with the remedies set forth
24 and the procedural protections and rights extended to Officers in this AGREEMENT are
25 adequate remedies at law for all disputes arising under this Article. 26
27	b) Expedited Arbitration 28
29 The parties have agreed to expedited arbitration for all unresolved grievances related to the
30 application or interpretation of this Article in order to achieve immediate resolution and to avoid
31 the need for court intervention in equity.  Such arbitrations shall be conducted pursuant to the
32 Expedited Labor Arbitration Procedures established by the American Arbitration Association
33 ("AAA"), and in effect at the time of the dispute. To be appointed, the arbitrator must be
34 available to hear the arbitration within thirty (30) calendar days of selection and a decision shall
35 be made within one (1) week of the hearing. The parties agree to create a list of pre-approved
36 arbitrators. Failing same, or in the absence of an available arbitrator from such pre-approved list,
37 the arbitrator designated by the AAA shall be required to be licensed as an attorney in the State
38 of Texas. The parties both agree that the arbitrator has the discretion to receive and hear issues
39 and testimony by written submission or phone conference, but may also require live testimony
40 where appropriate. 41

1 There shall be no legal or administrative requirement, including but not limited to subpoena
2 power or an order from the City Manager or the Department, that an officer appear before or
3 present evidence to any individual, panel, committee, group, or forum of any type involved in
4 Citizen Oversight.	This provision has no  application to  any Independent  Investigation
5 authorized by the Chief of Police or the City Manager, regardless of whether the Independent
6 Investigation was recommended by the Citizen's Review Panel or the Police Monitor, or to any
7 hearing of an appeal of disciplinary action pursuant to this AGREEMENT and/or Chapter 143 of
8 the Texas Local Government Code. Officers remain subject to orders or subpoenas to appear and
 9 provide testimony or evidence in such investigations or hearings. 10
11	Section 4. Access to Records by Officers
12
13 a) Not less than forty eight (48) hours before the Officer who is the subject of an
14 investigation provides a statement to an investigator, the Officer shall be provided a copy of the
15 complaint(s). The Department may omit the name and/or identity of the person making the
16 complaint. In the event that the complaint(s) does not contain all allegations of misconduct
17 under investigation, not less than forty eight (48) hours before the investigator begins the initial
18 oral or written interrogation of the Officer, the investigator must inform the Officer in writing of
19 the additional allegations being investigated. This paragraph does not apply to a Dismissal
20 Review Hearing or any other administrative hearing conducted for the purpose of determining
21 whether the Department shall take disciplinary action against an Officer for alleged misconduct. 22
23 b) Before the Officer who is the subject of an investigation provides a statement to an
24 investigator, the Officer and his representative shall be provided an opportunity to review any
25 videotape, photograph, or other recording of the operative conduct or alleged injuries, if any,
26 which is the subject of the allegations if such recording is within the possession or control of the
27 Department.
28
29 c) An Officer is entitled to a copy of his or her statement to the Internal Affairs Division at
30 the time when the statement is finalized and signed by the Officer, but the statement remains
31 confidential in the hands of the Officer pursuant to 143.089(g), APD policy, and orders of non-
32 communication about internal investigations, except for consultations with counsel and/or
33 ASSOCIATION representatives who are not involved in the investigation. 34
35 d) Before the Officer who is the subject of an investigation provides a statement to an
36 investigator, the Officer and his representative shall be allowed to review the portions of any
37 document(s) in which it is alleged that the Officer provided false, incomplete, inconsistent, or
38 conflicting information, or in which it is alleged that the Officer omitted information in violation
39 of any law or Department policy. 40
41 e) Before the Officer who is the subject of an investigation provides a statement to an
42 investigator, the Officer and his representative shall be allowed to review any report, supplement,
43 use of force report, or other statement recorded or written by the Officer, setting forth particulars
44 or facts regarding the operative conduct which is the subject of the allegation(s). 45

1 f) Not less than forty eight (48) hours before a Dismissal Review Hearing (or any other
2 administrative hearing conducted for the purpose of determining whether the Department shall
3 take disciplinary action against an Officer for alleged misconduct): 4
5 i) The Officer and his representative shall be allowed up to eight hours to review any
6 and all evidence gathered or obtained during the investigation. The evidence available for
7 review shall include the IA summary, if any; and 8
9 ii) The Department shall provide written notice of the alleged policy violations and the
10 specific range of discipline being considered. The Chief of Police shall not be restricted to the
11 alleged policy violations and/or the range of discipline provided pursuant to this subsection in
12 making the final decision as to discipline, if any. 13
14 g) When the Chief of Police is notified that the Panel plans to review a case involving a
15 "critical incident" or an allegation of a civil rights violation, the Officer and his representative
16 shall be given an opportunity to meet with the Internal Affairs investigator and review witness
17 statements and photographic or videotape evidence contained in the IA file, for up to eight hours. 18
19 h) Neither the Officer nor his representative will be permitted to make copies of any
20 witness statements, audio tapes, photographic or videotape evidence reviewed; however, they
21	may take written notes only, provided that they comply with the confidentiality and use
22	provisions in Section 6. 23
24 i) Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring the Department to provide or make
25 available for review by the Officer or his representative any evidence from criminal
26 investigations by the Austin Police Department unless that evidence is a part of the Internal
27 Affairs Division administrative file. No criminal investigation material that is part of the Internal
28 Affairs Department case file can be released if there is a pending criminal investigation or
29 judicial proceeding. 30
31	Section 5.  Dismissal Review Hearings (The Officer's Loudermill Hearing)
32
33 When a Dismissal Review Hearing (or any other administrative hearing conducted for the
34 purpose of determining whether the Department shall take disciplinary action against an Officer
35 for alleged misconduct), is held, the following procedures shall apply: 36
37 a) It shall be optional for the Officer who is the subject of the investigation to attend and
38 answer any questions at the hearing. Questions posed at the DRH do not constitute an
39 "investigation" as defined in Section 2d. No negative inference will be permitted should the
40 Officer elect not to attend or answer questions. If the Officer chooses not to attend or has
41 determined he/she will not answer any questions at the hearing, the Officer must give 48 hours-
42 notice to the Department by filling out the necessary waiver form. 43
44 b) Should the Officer choose to attend, the Officer may audio tape the portions of the
45 hearing in which the chain-of-command and Chief of Police or his designee discuss the IAD
46 investigation and the disciplinary decision with the Officer.

1
2	Section 6. Confidentiality of Records and Misuse of Information
3
4 The access to records provided in Section 4 of this Article has been granted in exchange for
5 the following agreements intended to insure confidentiality and to prevent retaliation or the
6 threat of retaliation against any witness in an investigation:
7
8 a) Information provided or made available for review remains confidential in the hands of
9 the Officer and his/her representative pursuant to 143.089(g), APD policy, and orders of non-
10 communication about internal investigations, except for consultations with counsel and/or
11 ASSOCIATION representatives who are not involved in the investigation. 12
13 b) Retaliation or the threat of retaliation by an Officer, or by an individual at the direction
14 of the Officer, against the author of an Internal Affairs statement is strictly prohibited. A
15 sustained violation of this subsection shall result in either a temporary or indefinite suspension. 16
17 c) If an Officer is suspended for an alleged violation of Subsection b, the Officer shall have
18 the right to appeal the suspension to the Civil Service Commission or to an Independent Third
19 Party Hearing Examiner pursuant to the provisions of this AGREEMENT and Chapter 143 of the
20 Texas Local Government Code. The Commission or the Hearing Examiner shall decide whether
21 the specific charge related to this Section is true. If the charge is found to be true, the
22 Commission or Hearing Examiner must affirm the disciplinary action and cannot amend, modify,
23 or reduce the period of disciplinary suspension. Sections 143.053(e) & (f) of the Texas Local
24 Government Code are hereby superseded to the extent of any conflict with this Section. 25
26	Section 7. Right to Representation
27
28 An Officer who is the subject of an investigation or administrative inquiry shall have the
29 right to be represented either by an attorney or an ASSOCIATION representative of the Officer's
30 choice during an interview, provided the attorney/representative complies with the Internal
31 Affairs interview protocol. An Officer shall have the right to be represented by either an
32 attorney or an ASSOCIATION representative of the Officer's choice during a Dismissal Review
33 Hearing (or administrative hearing conducted for the purpose of determining whether the
34 Department shall take disciplinary action against an Officer for alleged misconduct.) 35
36	Section 8. Violation of Officer's Rights
37
38 If the Department or any investigator violates any of the provisions of this Article or of
39 Section 143.312 of the Texas Local Government Code while conducting an investigation, the
40 violation may be considered by the Civil Service Commission or a Hearing Examiner in any
41 disciplinary appeal hearing if the violation substantially impaired the Officer's ability to defend
42 against the allegations of misconduct. 43
44	Section 9. Scheduling of Indefinite Suspension Appeal
45
46	If an Officer appeals an indefinite suspension to an Independent Third Party Hearing

1 Examiner, the parties will make a good faith effort to schedule the appeal of an indefinite
2 suspension within 90-180 days of the date the Officer was indefinitely suspended. 3

6 ARTICLE 18
7 DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS, DEMOTIONS & APPEALS
8
9	Section 1. Suspensions of Three (3) Days or Less
10
11	a) Appealable and Non-Appealable Suspensions 12
13 It is understood that most Officers will make some errors during their career involving
14 rule violations, including those who are good, professional Police Officers. The parties agree
15 that short disciplinary suspensions are for the purpose of reinforcing the need for compliance
16 with Departmental standards and not necessarily as punishment. 17
18 The parties agree that when an Officer is suspended for 1, 2, or 3 days, the Officer may
19 choose one of two methods of dealing with the suspensions as listed below: 20
21 (1) Suspensions that may not be appealed. The Officer may choose to use vacation or
22 holiday time to serve the suspension with no loss of paid salary and no break in
23 service for purposes of seniority, retirement, promotion, or any other purpose. The
24 Officer must agree that there is no right to appeal if this method of suspension is
25 chosen.
26
27 (2) Suspensions that may be appealed. The Officer may appeal the suspension to a
28 Hearing Examiner or the Civil Service Commission. If the Officer chooses to
29 appeal the suspension, the Hearing Examiner or Civil Service Commission's
30 authority is limited to ruling on whether or not the charges against the Officer are
31 true or not true. If the Hearing Examiner or Civil Service Commission finds the
32 charges to be true, there is no authority to mitigate the punishment. If the Hearing
33 Examiner or Civil Service Commission finds the charges to be not true, the Officer
34 shall be fully reinstated with no loss of pay or benefit. 35
36	b)  Hearing Costs on Appealable Suspensions 37
38 In the event that an Officer appeals a 1, 2 or 3 day suspension to a Hearing Examiner, it is
39 agreed that the party that loses the hearing shall be responsible for all costs of the Hearing
40 Examiner, including travel and lodging if necessary. 41
42 To facilitate such payment on the part of the Officer, he/she shall submit, at the time of
43 appeal, a signed payroll deduction agreement that if the Hearing Examiner rules in favor of the
44 CITY he/she authorizes up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month to be deducted from
45 his/her regular pay until such time as what would usually be the CITY's portion of the Hearing
46 Examiner's costs have been satisfied.

1
2	c) Reductions of Suspensions of Three (3) Days or Less to a Written Reprimand 3
4 The parties agree that temporary suspensions of 1, 2, or 3 days that were imposed on or
5 after March 25, 2001, will be automatically reduced to a written reprimand under the following
6 conditions:
7
Suspensions of 1, 2, or 3 days, which are/were not appealed, shall be reduced to a written reprimand two (2) years after the date the suspension was served on the Officer if:

i. The Officer does/did not have a sustained complaint for substantially similar conduct within two (2) years from the date the suspension was served on the Officer.

Suspensions of 1, 2, or 3 days, which are/were not appealed, shall be reduced to a written reprimand three (3) years after the date the suspension was served on the Officer if:

i. The Officer has been previously disciplined for substantially similar conduct, and;

ii. The Officer does/did not have a sustained complaint for substantially similar conduct within the next three (3) years from the date the suspension was served on the Officer.

Any controversy over whether or not the prior conduct was substantially similar may be presented to a Hearing Examiner under the other provisions of this Article.

Suspensions of 1, 2, or 3 days that are/were appealed to the Civil Service Commission or a Hearing Examiner are not eligible for reduction to a written reprimand under this AGREEMENT.

Suspensions of 1, 2, or 3 days that are/were reduced to a written reprimand shall not be introduced, cited, or used in any manner in subsequent disciplinary suspensions or appeals as to that Officer, but the original disciplinary decision is not covered by this Section as to contentions of disparate discipline by other Officers.

If the conditions set forth in subparts (a) or (b) are met, the Department shall notify the Civil Service Commission in writing that the temporary suspension has been reduced to a written reprimand. A copy of this document shall be included in the IAD investigative file, and the Department shall enter a notation in all disciplinary databases or records reflecting this change. The parties agree that the Department and the Civil Service Commission will not alter, destroy, conceal, or remove, any documents related to the temporary suspension, including but not limited to the

1 letter of temporary suspension that was filed with the Commission as required by
2 LGC 143.052(c), or the IAD investigative file itself. 3
4	Section 2.  Suspensions of Fifteen (15) Days or Less
5
6 If the Chief determines to suspend an Officer for fifteen (15) days or less, the Chief may, at
7 his sole discretion in hardship cases, authorize use of the Officer's accumulated vacation leave to
8 cover all or part of the suspension. It is also understood and agreed that if the Chief permits the
9 use of vacation days for suspension, such days off shall be considered as equal punishment to
10 traditional unpaid days of suspension. In no case will sick leave be substituted for unpaid days
11 of suspension.
12
13	Section 3. Mutually Agreed Temporary Suspensions of Sixteen (16) to Ninety (90) days.
14
15 a) The Police Chief may, in cases the Chief deems to warrant indefinite suspension, offer to
16 impose instead a suspension without pay for a period from sixteen (16) to ninety (90) days. If
17 the Officer accepts the mutually agreed suspension, there shall be no appeal either to the Civil
18 Service Commission, to the District Court or to a Hearing Examiner. It is also understood and
19 agreed that if the Chief permits the use of vacation days for suspension, such days off shall be
20 considered as equal punishment to traditional unpaid days of suspension. In no case will sick
21 leave be substituted for unpaid days of suspension. 22
23 b) In cases where the Officer's TCLEOSE license is suspended, the Chief of Police may
24 impose a non-appealable suspension commensurate with the period during which the license is
25 suspended.
26
27	Section 4. Payment for Accrued Leave Upon Indefinite Suspension.
28
29 a) An Officer who has been indefinitely suspended may, upon request, be paid in a lump
30 sum for up to two hundred forty (240) hours of accrued vacation and up to one hundred sixty
31 (160) hours of accrued exception vacation. 32
33 b) If the indefinite suspension is overturned as a result of the appeal, the Civil Service
34 Commission or a Hearing Examiner may restore such leave, but a total award of leave and back-
35 pay, if any, shall be offset by the amount paid to the Officer under Subsection a) above. 36
37	Section 5. Alternative Discipline by the Police Chief
38
39 In considering appropriate disciplinary action the Police Chief may require that an Officer be
40 evaluated by a qualified professional designated by the Police Chief. If that professional
41 recommends a program of counseling and/or rehabilitation for the Officer, the Police Chief may,
42 as an alternative to temporary or indefinite suspension, or in combination with a temporary
43 suspension, require that the Officer successfully complete the recommended program. The
44 program of counseling and/or rehabilitation will be completed on the Officer's off-duty time,
45 unless the Police Chief approves the use of accrued vacation leave or sick leave. The Officer
46 shall be responsible for paying all costs of the program of counseling and/or rehabilitation which

1 are not covered by the Officer's health insurance plan. If the Officer's misconduct involves
2 alcohol-related behavior, the Police Chief may require that the Officer submit to mandatory
3 alcohol testing, when ordered by the Police Chief, for a specified period of time. If, after
4 entering the program of counseling and/or rehabilitation, the Officer fails or refuses to complete
5 the program, the Officer may be indefinitely suspended. The Officer has the right to appeal to
6 the Police Civil Service Commission or to a third party Hearing Examiner any discipline
7 imposed under this section by filing an appeal notice in accordance with the provisions of
8 Chapter 143. On appeal, the Police Civil Service Commission or Hearing Examiner shall have
9 the same duties and powers set forth in Chapter 143, but shall not have the power to substitute a
10 program of counseling and/or rehabilitation different from the program imposed by the Police
11 Chief or to substitute any period of suspension for the required program of counseling and/or
12 rehabilitation.
13
14	Section 6. Alternative Discipline by Agreement
15
16 In considering appropriate disciplinary action, the Police Chief may require that an Officer be
17 evaluated by a qualified professional designated by the Police Chief. If that professional
18 recommends a program of counseling and/or rehabilitation for the Officer, the Police Chief may
19 offer the Officer the opportunity to enter into an alternative disciplinary agreement under which
20 the Officer would accept a temporary suspension of up to ninety (90) days and agree to
21 successfully complete the program of counseling and/or rehabilitation recommended by the
22 qualified professional designated by the Police Chief. The program of counseling and/or
23 rehabilitation will be completed on the Officer's off duty time, unless the Police Chief approves
24 the use of accrued vacation leave or sick leave. The Officer shall be responsible for paying all
25 costs of the program of counseling and/or rehabilitation, which are not covered by the Officer's
26 health insurance plan. If the Officer's misconduct involved alcohol related behavior, the Police
27 Chief may require that the Officer submit to mandatory alcohol testing, when ordered by the
28 Police Chief, for a specified period of time. If the Officer accepts the opportunity for agreed
29 alternative discipline, the Officer may not appeal any terms of the Agreement. If the Officer fails
30 to successfully complete the program of counseling and/or rehabilitation, the Officer may be
31 indefinitely suspended without right of appeal. 32
33	Section 7. Last Chance Agreement
34
35 a) In considering appropriate disciplinary action, the Police Chief may require that an
36 Officer be evaluated by a qualified professional designated by the Police Chief. If that
37 professional recommends a program of counseling and/or rehabilitation for the Officer, the
38 Police Chief may offer the Officer, as an alternative to indefinite suspension, the opportunity to
39 enter into a last chance agreement. The agreement may include the following provisions in
40 addition to any other provisions agreed upon by the Officer and the Police Chief. 41
42 (1) The Officer will successfully complete the program of counseling and/or
43 rehabilitation recommended by the qualified professional designated by the Police
44 Chief.
45

1 (2) The program of counseling and/or rehabilitation will be completed on the Officer's
2 off-duty time, unless the Police Chief approves the use of accrued vacation leave or
3 sick leave. The Officer shall be responsible for paying all costs of the program of
4 counseling and/or rehabilitation, which are not covered by the Officer's health
5 insurance plan.
6
7 (3) The Officer will agree to a probationary period not to exceed one (1) year, with the
8 additional requirement that if, during the probationary period, the Officer commits
9 the same or a similar act of misconduct, the Officer will be indefinitely suspended
10 without right of appeal. 11
12 b) If the Officer's misconduct involves alcohol-related behavior, the Police Chief may
13 require that the Officer submit to mandatory alcohol testing, upon order by the Police Chief, for a
14 specified period of time. If the Officer accepts the opportunity for a last chance agreement, the
15 Officer may not appeal any terms of the agreement. If the Officer fails to successfully complete
16 the agreed upon program, the Officer may be indefinitely suspended without right of appeal. 17
18	Section 8. Extending Disciplinary Deadline by Agreement
19
20 a) An Officer and the Chief, or designee, may agree to extend any statutory deadline for
21 imposing discipline for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. Either the Officer or the Chief
22	may offer or request the extension. The agreement to extend the statutory deadline shall be in
23	writing and shall be signed by both the Officer and the Chief, or designee. 24
25 b) Any disciplinary action taken by the Chief before the extended deadline shall be
26 considered timely. An agreement to extend the deadline does not affect an Officer's right of
27 appeal from the disciplinary action. 28
29	Section 9. Hearing Examiner Retained
30
31 The CITY recognizes that during the term of this AGREEMENT Officers have the right to
32 an appeal of an indefinite suspension or suspension for a definite number of days (subject to the
33 provisions herein on non-appealable suspensions of 1 to 3 days) before a Hearing Examiner as
34 provided in Section 143.057 of the Texas Local Government Code. During the term of this
35 AGREEMENT, the parties specifically agree to retain this right of appeal, as modified herein,
36 notwithstanding any change to Section 143.057 which may occur as a result of court or
37 legislative action.
38
39	Section 10. Hearing Examiner Provisions
40
41 In order to be mutually accepted on the hearing examiners list, an individual must be
42 impartial to the ASSOCIATION and the CITY, shall be a member of the American Arbitration
43 Association (AAA), have formal training in presentation and evaluation of evidence, and have
44 experience in deciding municipal employment issues. 45
46

1 Section 11. Procedures for Hearings Before the Civil Service Commission and
2 Independent Hearing Examiners
3
4 It is expressly agreed that Civil Service Commission hearings and hearings before Hearing
5 Examiners under 143.057 are informal administrative hearings and are not subject to discovery
6 or evidentiary processes. Specifically it is understood that neither the Texas Rules of Evidence
7 (TRE) or the Texas Rules of Court (TRC) apply to such hearings. If the Department calls a
8 witness to testify during a hearing and that witness has given a statement to Internal Affairs
9 regarding the pending case, then the Department will provide a copy of that statement to the
10 Officer's counsel/representative at the time the witness is called to testify. 11
12	Section 12. Procedures Before Hearing Examiners
13
14	In any proceeding before a hearing examiner, the following procedures shall be followed: 15
16 a) The Department shall furnish the charge letter to the Hearing Examiner by delivering
17 a copy to the AAA far enough in advance, so that the Hearing Examiner receives the
18 copy at least five (5) days before the start of the hearing. 19
20 b) The Officer may furnish a position statement to the Hearing Examiner by delivering
21 copies to the AAA and to the Department far enough in advance, so that the Hearing
22 Examiner and the Department receives the copies at least five (5) days before the start
23 of the hearing. 24
25 c) At the close of the presentation of evidence, the Hearing Examiner shall conduct a
26 post-hearing conference with counsel/representatives for the Department and the
27 Officer and advise them as to what issue(s) the Hearing Examiner wants covered in
28 post-hearing briefs. This does not preclude either party from briefing anything not
29 requested by the Hearing Examiner. 30
31 d) Failure of the AAA to meet its obligations as set out in this Subsection does not
32 jeopardize the hearing rights of either the CITY or the Officer. 33
34	Section 13. Special Appeal Process for Demotions
35
36 a) This Section applies only to involuntary demotions based on misconduct or performance
37 issues. It does not apply to the following:
38
39 (1) Demotions related to the return from military service of another officer;
40 (2) Demotions caused by a reduction in force;
41 (3) Demotions related to the reinstatement of another officer after recovery from a
42 disability;
43 (4) Demotions from the rank of Assistant Chief of Police;
44 (5) Demotions related to the reinstatement of another officer after indefinite
45 suspension; or
46 (6) Demotions due to return to work of an ASSOCIATION representative on ABL.

1
2 b) If the Chief chooses to demote an Officer, the Chief shall file with the Civil Service
3 Commission a written statement giving the reasons for the demotion. A copy of the written
4 statement shall be furnished immediately to the affected Officer. 5
6 c) The Officer may appeal the demotion by filing a written appeal notice with the Director of
7 Civil Service within ten (10) days after the date of the demotion. The Officer may elect to
8 appeal to an independent third-party Hearing Examiner selected in accordance with the
9 provisions of Section 143.057 of the Local Government Code, as amended by this
10 AGREEMENT. The Officer's election to appeal to a Hearing Examiner must be contained in the
11 Officer's initial notice of appeal.
12
13 d) During the pendency of the appeal, the Officer's rank and pay shall not be changed but
14 the Chief may reassign the Officer to perform duties appropriate to the rank held by the Officer
15 immediately prior to the promotion. The Officer's absence from his promoted position shall not
16 create a vacancy, but the Chief may pay higher classification pay to another Officer to perform
17 the duties of the promoted position. 18
19 e) If the Officer appeals to the Civil Service Commission, the decision of the Commission is
20 final and may not be appealed further. If the Officer appeals to a Hearing Examiner, the decision
21	may be appealed only on the grounds that the Hearing Examiner was without jurisdiction or
22 exceeded its jurisdiction or that the order was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful
23 means.
24
25 f) If the Commission or Hearing Examiner upholds the Chief's demotion, the Officer shall
26 be returned to the rank held immediately prior to the promotion, the Officer's pay shall be
27 adjusted accordingly, and the Officer's name shall be permanently removed from the
28 promotional eligibility list if the list is still in effect. The Officer's time in grade in the promoted
29 position shall not count toward eligibility for future promotion. 30
31 g) If the Commission or Hearing Examiner overturns the Chief's demotion, the Officer shall
32 be returned to the promoted rank in an assignment to be determined by the Chief. 33
34 h) This Section shall be entitled to preemption including but not limited to Sections
35 143.010, 143.015, 143.054, 143.057 and all provisions of Subchapter B of the Texas Local
36 Government Code Chapter 143. 37
38	Section 14. Substitution of Demotion for Indefinite Suspension
39
40 In the appeal of an indefinite suspension, the Civil Service Commission or a Hearing
41 Examiner may substitute a demotion for the indefinite suspension imposed by the Chief. 42
43	Section 15. Mediation
44
45 The CITY shall implement a voluntary mediation process concerning both citizen and
46 internal complaints. The ASSOCIATION may appoint two persons to work with the CITY in

1 developing the specific operating procedure. The process shall include and be based upon the
2 following concepts:
3
4 a) Mediation shall be an option offered to the complainant at the time the initial
5 complaint is filed for minor nature complaints, such as rudeness. 6
7 b) For a complaint to proceed to mediation, both the Officer and the complainant must
8 voluntarily agree. 9
10 c) Once mediation has been agreed to, the matter cannot be returned to the Department
11 to be handled as a disciplinary matter. 12
13	Section 16. Effect of Contract Expiration
14
15 The provisions of this AGREEMENT shall remain in full force and effect after expiration of
16 this AGREEMENT as to:
17
18 a) Any investigation assigned a Control Number by the Internal Affairs Division prior to
19 the expiration of this AGREEMENT; 20
21 b) Any disciplinary decision by the Chief prior to the expiration of this AGREEMENT;
22 or
23
24	c) Any appeals of such disciplinary action. 25
26
27	Section 17. Authority of the Civil Service Commission/Hearing Examiner
28
29 If an Officer is indefinitely or temporarily suspended, the Officer shall have the right to
30 appeal the suspension to the Civil Service Commission or to an Independent Third Party Hearing
31 Examiner pursuant to the provisions of this AGREEMENT and Chapter 143 of the Texas Local
32 Government Code. The Commission or the Hearing Examiner shall decide whether the specific
33 charge related to this Section is true. If the charge is found to be true, the Commission or
34 Hearing Examiner may affirm or reduce the suspension imposed by the Chief of Police to a
35 temporary suspension not to exceed 180 days. 36
37	Section 18. Access to IAD File
38
39 If an Officer appeals a disciplinary action, and provides a written request, the CITY will
40 provide to the Officer and his/her representative a copy of the unredacted IAD file within five (5)
41 business days of receiving the request. The file remains confidential in the hands of the Officer
42 and his/her representative to the extent the release of such information is still protected from
43 public disclosure by Local Government Code Section 143.089(g) or other law. Additionally, all
44 individuals who have access by virtue of this AGREEMENT to IAD files or investigative
45 information, including the information contained within the 143.089(g) files of Officers, shall be
46 bound to the same extent as the Austin Police Department and the City of Austin to comply with

1 the confidentiality provisions of this AGREEMENT, Chapter 143 of the Texas Local
2 Government Code, and the Texas Public Information Act. All such individuals shall further be
3 bound to the same extent as the Austin Police Department and the City of Austin to respect the
4 rights of individual Officers under the Texas Constitution and the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth
5 Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including not revealing information contained in a
6 compelled statement protected by the doctrine set forth in Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493
7 (1967), and Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967). The Officer and his/her representative shall
8 not be provided information contained within an IAD file that is made confidential by a law
9 other than Chapter 143 of the Texas Local Government Code, such as records concerning
10 juveniles, sexual assault victims, and individuals who have tested positive for HIV. 11

22 in advance, the Department will provide a twenty-eight (28) calendar-day notice to the affected
23 Officer. Advance notice of the assignment change is not required if prior notice is not in the best
24 interest of the Department or in any emergency situations. Advance notice of the assignment
25 change may be waived by the Officer. 26
27	b) Hardship Transfers 28
29 In the event of special hardship, an affected Officer may appeal to the Assistant Chief of
30 their Bureau for consideration of temporary scheduling or other adjustments to reduce or address
31 personal hardships. The Chief shall create a joint committee with representatives appointed by
32 the ASSOCIATION to evaluate hardship claims and to recommend action to the Assistant Chief. 33

35
36 a) A list of all currently vacant positions throughout the Department will be maintained on
37 the APD intranet and available for review by Officers. Absent exigent circumstances, a vacancy
38 will be posted on the APD intranet as near as possible to 10 days prior to the application
39 deadline. 40
41 b) A reasonable, good faith effort shall be made to post initial assignment vacancies. It is
42 recognized and understood that notice cannot be sent for all backfill transfers resulting from the
43 initial vacancies.
44
45 c) The posting process shall not apply to vacancies that the Department fills by promotion,
46 vacancies filled during Department-wide leveling, involuntary transfers, or mutually agreed

1	swaps.
2
3 d) All Officers are eligible to seek transfer to any vacancies within the Department for
4 which they are qualified. Oral or written reprimands shall not affect an Officer's ability to apply
5 for a transfer to a sought after position, but may be considered along with all other factors in
6 making a selection among applicants. 7
8 e) Applying for a posted position shall neither jeopardize nor insure an Officer's current
9 assignment. The Chief shall establish a committee with representatives appointed by the
10 ASSOCIATION to recommend changes or improvements in the process of posting notice of job
11 assignment opportunities or openings. 12
13	Section 3. Proposed Adjustments to Work Schedules

20 impact upon working conditions of affected Officers, the Commander or Assistant Chief
21 contemplating that adjustment shall notify the President of the ASSOCIATION in writing of the
22 proposed work schedule adjustment at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to its implementation.
23 Advanced notice shall not be required in emergency situations. The ASSOCIATION, after

27 possible impact upon the affected Officers. The involved Commander/Assistant Chief shall be
28 required to meet with the President of the ASSOCIATION within five (5) business days of this
29 written request. If the ASSOCIATION and the Commander/Assistant Chief do not resolve the
30 ASSOCIATION's concerns, the President of the ASSOCIATION may schedule a meeting with

32 The final decision to implement the proposed work schedule adjustment shall be retained by the
33 Chief of Police. 34

2 f) The failure to notify and meet with the President of the ASSOCIATION as provided in
3 this Article is subject to the AGREEMENT grievance procedure set forth in Article 20 of this

8
9 a) It is recognized that Command Staff, through the authority of the Chief of Police, retains
10 the right to set policy and procedures for employees, which may vary from one operational unit
11 or division to another. On the other hand, the ASSOCIATION has a legitimate interest in
12 providing input on behalf of its members as to the choices to implement variations in policy that
13 have an impact on members. 14
15 b) In the event of a proposed adjustment to policies which differ or vary between units or
16 divisions, the Commander or Assistant Chief contemplating that adjustment shall notify the
17 President of the ASSOCIATION in writing of the proposed change at least thirty (30) calendar
18 days prior to its implementation. Advanced notice shall not be required in emergency situations.

22 and has least possible impact upon the affected Officers. The involved Commander/Assistant
23 Chief shall be required to meet with the President of the ASSOCIATION within five (5) business
24 days of this written request. If the ASSOCIATION and the Commander/Assistant Chief do not
25 resolve the ASSOCIATION's concerns, the President of the ASSOCIATION may schedule a

27 the matter. The final decision to implement the proposed policy or procedure change shall be

30 c) This section shall not apply to any policy and procedure changes made as a result of an
31 emergency or unforeseen event, staffing shortages, or emergency crime threats to the

33 Police to make changes in policy and procedure in response to  unforeseen events and
34 emergencies.

12 is not possible, the Officer will be granted 20 hours of Administrative Leave. Failure to utilize
13 any part of these hours by December 31st of the year accrued will result in forfeiture of the accrued
14 Administrative Leave hours. 15
16 c) When the ASSOCIATION President knows or should know of the Department's failure
17 to provide advance notice as required by this Section, the ASSOCIATION President shall
18 promptly notify the Chief or designee and the Labor Relations Office. 19
20	d) This Section shall not apply to:
21

26 (2) A significant schedule change caused, less than twenty-eight (28) days prior to the
27 Special Event, by an unforeseen change in the schedule or scope of the Special Event. 28

38	The steps of this grievance procedure are as follows:
39
40	Step 1
41
42	a) Filing of Grievance 43
44 The ASSOCIATION President or an aggrieved Officer who desires to file a grievance
45 under this procedure must file his/her grievance with the Association Grievance Committee
46 within thirty (30) business days after the ASSOCIATION President or the Officer knew of or

1 should have known of the facts or event(s) giving rise to the grievance. A copy of the grievance
2 shall be forwarded to the Chief of Police, or designee, by the Association Grievance Committee
3 within three (3) business days after receipt of the grievance. 4
5	b)  Response by Association Grievance Committee 6
7 Within fifteen (15) business days after its receipt of a grievance filed by an individual
8 Officer or filed on behalf of the ASSOCIATION under this procedure, the Association
9 Grievance Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, if a valid grievance exists. If the
10 Association Grievance Committee determines that the grievance is valid, the grievance shall
11 proceed to Step 2 of this procedure. If the Association Grievance Committee determines that the
12 grievance is not valid, the ASSOCIATION President will notify the Chief that no further
13 proceedings are necessary. 14
15	Step 2
16
17 Any grievance found to be valid by the Association Grievance Committee shall be submitted
18 to the Chief of Police within fifteen (15) business days of the Step 1 ruling. Each grievance shall
19 be submitted on a form agreed to by the parties and must include:
20
21	(1) A brief statement of the grievance and the facts or events upon which it is based; 22
23	(2) The section(s) of the AGREEMENT alleged to have been violated; 24
25	(3) The steps taken, if any, by the grievant to resolve the issue; and 26
27	(4) A proposed resolution of the grievance. 28
29 A grievance submitted in substantial compliance with this section shall not be denied on the
30 basis of form. Within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the Step 2 grievance, the Chief
31 of Police shall submit a written response to the Association Grievance Committee. 32
33	Step 3
34
35 If a grievance is not resolved at Step 2 , the ASSOCIATION may within fifteen (15) business
36 days after receipt of the Chief's Step 2 response, submit the grievance to arbitration in
37 accordance with the provisions of this AGREEMENT. The grievance arbitration procedure shall
38 be implemented by the ASSOCIATION notifying the Chief of Police in writing of its intent to
39 submit the grievance to arbitration. 40
41	Step 4
42
43 The arbitration hearing will be scheduled by agreement at the earliest date possible,
44 preferably within thirty (30) business days after submitting the grievance to arbitration. The
45 arbitrator will be selected as agreed or under the AAA process. 46

1 The hearing shall be held at a location which is convenient for all parties and the arbitrator
2 and shall be conducted informally, without strict evidentiary or procedural rules. Unless
3 otherwise mutually agreed, the submission to the arbitrator shall be based on the written
4 grievance statement submitted by the Association Grievance Committee at Step 2. The arbitrator
5 shall consider and decide only the issue(s) in the grievance statement or submitted in writing by
6 agreement of the parties. The hearing shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible and the
7 arbitrator's written decision shall be provided to both parties within thirty (30) calendar days
8 after close of the hearing, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. 9
10 The parties specifically agree that the arbitrator's authority shall be strictly limited to
11 interpreting and applying the explicit provisions of this AGREEMENT. The arbitrator shall not
12 have authority to modify the AGREEMENT or create additional provisions not included in the
13 AGREEMENT. The parties agree that neither the CITY nor the ASSOCIATION shall have ex
14 parte communications with the arbitrator concerning any matter involved in the grievance
15 submitted to the arbitrator. 16
17 Each party shall be responsible for its own expenses in preparing for and representing itself
18 at arbitration. The fees of the arbitrator shall be borne by the losing party. In the event of a
19 composite decision, the arbitrator shall determine the portion of such cost to be borne by each
20 party. The written decision of the arbitrator may be appealed only on the grounds that the
21 arbitrator was without jurisdiction or exceeded his jurisdiction; that the decision was procured by
22 fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means; or that the arbitrator's decision is based upon a clear
23 and manifest error of law. 24
25	Section 5. Election of Remedies
26
27 It is specifically and expressly understood that filing a grievance under this Article, which
28 has as its last step final and binding arbitration, constitutes an election of remedies. 29
30	Section 6. Statutory Appeals and Hearings
31
32 Except as specifically provided in this AGREEMENT, all statutory rights of appeal to the
33 Civil Service Commission or Hearing Examiner, including disciplinary matters, promotional
34 bypasses, and demotions will be governed by Chapter 143 and are not subject to this contract
35 grievance procedure. 36
37
38
39 ARTICLE 21
40 TERM OF AGREEMENT
41
42	Section 1. Term of Agreement
43
44 a) This AGREEMENT shall be effective as of the date it is ratified by the City Council,
45 except as to any provisions herein specifically made effective on any other date. It shall remain
46 in full force and effect, subject to the provisions of this Article, until September 30, 2017.

1
2 b) The provisions of this AGREEMENT do not apply to any Officer who separates from
3 CITY employment before the effective date of this AGREEMENT or before the effective date of
4 any specific provisions hereof. 5
6	Section 2. Continuing Relationship
7
8 a) The parties acknowledge their longstanding history of successful Meet & Confer
9 negotiations and their joint efforts to continue to build on the framework of each previous
10 agreement. This AGREEMENT is the product of that relationship and negotiation history. This
11 includes agreements on the issues which may require a contractual modification of existing civil
12 service law (access to the 143.089(g) file, and release of defined reports from Independent
13 Investigations and the CRP), agreements to outline the broad concepts of citizen oversight, and
14 agreements which clarify rights which exist with or without the AGREEMENT. Other aspects
15 of the CITY's implementation of citizen oversight are its prerogatives under Texas law and the
16 City Charter, and do not require contractual provisions. Both parties recognize that without the
17 continued ability of the CITY to carry out citizen oversight, this agreement would not have been
18 reached, either as to the economic issues or the additional provisions for the procedural
19 protections of Officer's rights.
20
21 b) In the event of any court order, judgment, Texas Attorney General's opinion or
22 arbitration decision brought or caused by Officers or the APA which substantially impairs
23 oversight access to the 143.089(g) file, prevents release of the defined portions of reports of
24 Independent Investigation and the CRP, invalidates the 180 tolling provision in Article 16, or
25 impairs the CITY's right to expedited arbitration as contemplated herein, the CITY may reopen
26 negotiations to resolve and correct the issue or provide an alternate resolution. If a negotiated
27 resolution of the issue is not achieved, the CITY may terminate this AGREEMENT after ninety
28 (90) days written notice, and the parties may resume negotiations toward a successor agreement
29 under the provisions Section 143.301 et.seq., of the Texas Local Government Code. 30
31 c) In the event of any court order, judgment, Texas Attorney General's opinion or
32 arbitration decision brought or caused by the City of Austin or other party with standing under
33 this AGREEMENT substantially impairs the provisions of Article 17 pertaining to Officer's
34 rights, or which would allow full access to investigative evidence of Officer misconduct in the
35 absence of a disciplinary decision imposed by the Chief, the APA may reopen negotiations to
36 resolve and correct the issue or provide an alternate resolution. If a negotiated resolution of the
37 issue is not achieved, the CITY may terminate this AGREEMENT after ninety (90) days written
38 notice, and the parties may resume negotiations toward a successor agreement under the
39 provisions Section 143.301 et.seq., of the Texas Local Government Code. 40
41	Section 3. Notice and Renegotiation
42
43 If either the CITY or the ASSOCIATION desires to engage in negotiation for a successor
44 Agreement, then either or both shall give the other party written notice of its desire to negotiate
45 for a new Agreement no less than 120 days before the expiration of the present AGREEMENT.
46 In the event that notice of intent to renegotiate is given by either party, and the parties agree, the

1 parties will begin negotiations for a new Agreement not later than sixty (60) days after notice is
2 given, unless the parties agree otherwise. 3
4	Section 4. Continuation During Negotiations
5
6 If the parties are engaged in negotiations for a successor Agreement at the time this
7 AGREEMENT expires, the ASSOCIATION's and the CITY's negotiating teams shall have the
8 authority to extend this AGREEMENT in thirty (30) calendar day increments by mutual written
9 agreement, during any period of good faith negotiations after such termination date, not to
10 exceed a total of six (6) months. 11
12	Section 5. Effect of Termination
13
14 a) In the event that a successor Agreement has not been ratified before the expiration date of
15 this AGREEMENT (the expiration date of September 30, 2017, or any extended expiration date
16 under Section 4 above), all provisions of this AGREEMENT, both economic and non-economic,
17 shall expire and no longer be in full force and effect, except as to specific Articles or Sections
18 hereof which provide that some or all of their terms will continue beyond expiration of this
19 AGREEMENT. 20
21 b) After expiration/termination of this AGREEMENT, it is expressly understood that the
22 wages and compensation specified in this AGREEMENT may then be placed at a level
23 determined by the City Manager, as funds are authorized by the City Council, and this does not
24 preclude wages and compensation being rolled back to pre-contract levels, as they existed on the
25 day prior to the effective date of this AGREEMENT. 26
27	Section 6. Funding Obligations
28
29 The CITY presently intends to continue this AGREEMENT each fiscal year through its term,
30 to pay all payments due, and to fully and promptly perform all of the obligations of the CITY
31 under this AGREEMENT. All obligations of the CITY shall be paid only out of current
32 revenues or any other funds lawfully available therefore and appropriated for such purpose by
33 the City Council, in compliance with the Texas Constitution, Article XI, Sections 5 and 7. In the
34 event that the City of Austin cannot meet its funding obligations, as provided in the State
35 Constitution, this entire AGREEMENT becomes null and void. 36

40 NOTICES
41
42	Section 1. Association Notices
43
44 Notices the ASSOCIATION is required to provide to the CITY under this AGREEMENT or
45 Chapter 143, unless specifically noted otherwise, will be provided in writing to the office of the
46 Chief of Police, the Labor Relations Office and the designated lawyer in the City Attorney's

1	Office. 2
3	Section 2. City Notices
4
5 Notices the CITY is required to provide to the ASSOCIATION under this AGREEMENT or
6 Chapter 143, unless specifically noted otherwise, will be provided in writing to the
7 ASSOCIATION President's office and the ASSOCIATION's designated attorney.
8
9	Section 3. Designation of Notice Recipients
10
11 Within 10 calendar days after the effective date of this AGREEMENT, both parties will
12 provide the other written notice of the correct mailing and e-mail addresses of its designated
13 recipients.
14
15	Section 4. Timeliness of Mail Notice
16
17 A notice provided by mail will be deemed timely if addressed to the two correct mailing
18 addresses for the CITY or the ASSOCIATION and postmarked no later than the date such notice
19 is due.
20
21	Section 5. Adequacy of Email Notice
22
23 Use of email communications under this paragraph shall be preceded by confirmed
24 exchanges at the outset of the AGREEMENT, from the sending to receiving servers, prior to
25 using the email option for notices under this Section. Each party agrees to provide notice of any
26 change in email addresses of any designated recipient following the initial exchange of emails.
27 In recognition of the fact that email systems are dependent on a number of technical factors, the
28 parties agree to confirm the receipt of email notices by sending a "read receipt" to the other party
29 or sending a brief acknowledgment of receipt. A notice sent by e-mail will be deemed timely if
30 addressed to the two correct e-mail addresses for the CITY or the ASSOCIATION and sent by
31 4:59 p.m. on the due date. 32
33	Section 6. Notice of Address Changes
34
35 The parties agree to provide written notice of any changes of physical address or e-mail
36 address to the other party within 7 calendar days of the change. 37
38
39 ARTICLE 23
40 ENTIRE AGREEMENT
41
42	Section 1. Subjects and Issues
43
44 The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this AGREEMENT,
45 each had the unlimited right and opportunity to raise issues and make proposals with respect to
46 any subject or matter not removed by law from the meet and confer process, and that the

1 understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and
2 opportunity are set forth in this AGREEMENT. Therefore, the CITY and the ASSOCIATION,
3 for the duration of this AGREEMENT, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waive the right, and
4 each agrees that the other shall not be obligated, to meet and confer with respect to any subject or
5 matter referred to, or covered in this AGREEMENT, or with respect to any subject or matter not
6 specifically referred to or covered in this AGREEMENT, even though such subjects or matters
7	may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the
8 time they negotiated or signed this AGREEMENT, except as provided for single issue
 9 negotiation above. 10
11	Section 2. Amendment of the Agreement
12
13 a) Except as explicitly provided for in this AGREEMENT, this AGREEMENT may be
14 amended during its term by the parties only by written mutual agreement ratified in
15 accordance with the provisions of Chapter 143. 16
17 b) The parties may mutually agree to corrections or clarifications by Memorandum of
18 Agreement with the authority of the Board of Directors of the ASSOCIATION and the City
19 Manager for the CITY. 20
21	Section 3. Benefit of the Bargain
22
23 a) In the event that the Texas Legislature amends any provision of Texas Local Government
24 Code Chapters 141, 142 or 143, which changes wages or benefits for City of Austin Police
25 Officers during the term of this AGREEMENT, any such amendment shall not be applicable to
26 the Officers covered by this AGREEMENT, unless the City Council adopts such amendment by
27 Ordinance. Examples of wages and benefits include, but are not limited to, base salary,
28 longevity, assignment pay, sick leave, vacation, health insurance, and weapon provision
29 mandates.
30
31 b) During the negotiation of this AGREEMENT, the CITY and the ASSOCIATION have
32 agreed on the stated enhancements to employee compensation and benefits, in reliance on the
33 cost of those enhancements. Both parties acknowledge that this AGREEMENT would not have
34 been reached, as reflected in this document, if the cost to the CITY had been higher. In the event
35 of any proceeding in which the ASSOCIATION asserts the right to additional compensation or
36 pay enhancements based on the provisions of this AGREEMENT, the decision-maker shall
37 consider the cost of the contractual pay and benefits enhancements as part of the mutual
38 agreement and meeting of the minds that resulted in approval of this AGREEMENT by both
39 parties.

43 Article 24
44 SAVINGS CLAUSE/PREEMPTION
45
46	Section 1. Effect of Illegal Provision

1
2 If any provision of this AGREEMENT is subsequently declared by legislative or judicial
3 authority to be unlawful, unenforceable, or not in accordance with applicable statues, all other
4 provisions of this AGREEMENT shall remain in full force and effect for the duration of this
5 AGREEMENT, and the parties shall meet as soon as possible to agree on a substitute provision. 6
7	Section 2.  Preemption of Local Government Code & Other Provisions
8
9 a) "Conflict preemption" intended unless otherwise specified. Texas Local Gov't Code
10 §143.307 authorizes the parties to preempt "any contrary statute, executive order, local
11 ordinance, or rule adopted by the state or a political subdivision or agent of the state, including a
12 personnel board, a civil service commission, or a home-rule municipality" through a labor
13 agreement. To the full extent authorized by §143.307, the parties agree that the provisions of
14 this AGREEMENT shall preempt those portions of any state statute, executive order, local
15 ordinance, or rule with which they specifically conflict only to the extent of such conflict;
16 remaining portions of such provisions will continue to govern the parties' actions.
17
18 b) "Total preemption" only where specified. However, to the extent allowed by §143.307,
19 the parties may totally preempt a state statute, executive order, local ordinance, or rule, by
20 placing a provision in this AGREEMENT that: (1) specifically states it is intended to "totally
21 preempt" the law in question, and (2) specifically identifies the law(s) being totally preempted.
22
23	Section 3. Change in Authorized Representative
24
25 During the term of this AGREEMENT, if there is a lawful withdrawal of recognition of the
26 Austin Police Association pursuant to Section 143.304 of the Texas Local Government Code,
27 then it will be the CITY's option to continue the terms of this AGREEMENT or to cancel the
28 contract and engage in negotiations with the successor organization, if any. 29
30

34
35	Section 1. Definitions

38 a different definition is required by the context in which the term is used: 39
40 a) "PSEM" refers to the City of Austin Public Safety and Emergency Management
41 Department, which was dissolved as a result of the consolidation of certain PSEM law
42 enforcement officers into the Austin Police Department. 43

13 Civil Service employees, subject to the provisions of this AGREEMENT. 14
15 b) The parties hereby ratify the initial placement of PSEM law enforcement officers into the
16 APD Civil Service Rank of Police Officer, regardless of their previous positions or rank in
17 PSEM. Any change in rank resulting from the consolidation transition shall not be construed as
18 a demotion under either Civil Service law or the City's Personnel Policies. A former PSEM law
19 enforcement officer whose rank changed as a result of the consolidation transition may not file a
20 grievance regarding that change in rank under the grievance process set out in this
21 AGREEMENT or under the City's Personnel Policies.
22
23	Section 3. Wages and Benefits
24
25 a) The parties hereby ratify the initial placement of PSEM law enforcement officers into the
26 APD Base Salary Schedule. The parties agree that after initial placement, former PSEM officers
27 will advance through the step pay program in sequence based on the Officer's initial placement
28 without regard to the Officer's years of service with APD or PSEM prior to October 1, 2008.
29
30 b) Each former PSEM law enforcement officer will receive longevity pay as provided in
31 Article 7 of this AGREEMENT based on the Officer's cumulative years of service with both
32 PSEM and APD.
33
34 c) Any change in compensation resulting from the consolidation transition shall not be
35 construed as a demotion or promotion under Civil Service law, this AGREEMENT, or the
36 CITY's Personnel Policies. A former PSEM law enforcement officer whose compensation
37 changed as a result of the consolidation transition may not file a grievance regarding that change
38 in compensation under the grievance process set out in this AGREEMENT or under the CITY's
39 Personnel Policies.
40
41	Section 4. Transfer of Special Vacation Balances
42
43 a) Special vacation balances of former PSEM law enforcement officers due to settlement of
44 claims regarding vacation accrual rates have been transferred to APD and shall remain subject to
45 the terms of the applicable settlement agreement. 46

3 Accrued sick leave will be paid to former PSEM law enforcement officers under the
4 following conditions:
5
6 a) An Officer who retires under both the City of Austin Employees Retirement System and
7 the Austin Police Retirement System, will be paid for all accrued sick leave in accordance with
8 the provisions of Article 9, except that the 12-year service requirement shall not apply. 9
10 b) An Officer who was hired by the City of Austin prior to October 1, 1986, who separates

14 c) An Officer who was hired after October 1, 1986, who separates from the CITY after the
15 effective date of this Article for any reason other than retirement will be paid for accrued sick
16 leave in accordance with Article 9 of this Agreement, but years of service with PSEM will not be
17 counted as years of service with APD for purposes of the 12-year service requirement. 18
19	Section 6.	Promotional Eligibility
20
21 A PSEM law enforcement officer who successfully completes the transition and becomes an
22 APD Officer shall be eligible to take the promotional examination for the rank immediately
23 above Police Officer upon completion of five (5) years of service. For purposes of calculating
24 the required five (5) years of service, all service with APD after the Transition Completion Date
25 plus up to three (3) years of continuous service in PSEM immediately prior to the effective date
26 of this Article shall be counted toward the requirement. 27
28	Section 7. Conditions Precedent
29
30 Approximately six (6) years after the System began participating in the Proportionate
31 Retirement Program, the System's actuary must conduct a five-year experience study to
