Re: DUTY CHARTS

Dear Sergeant Mullins:

       The City and the Sergeants Benevolent Association r·sBA") acknowledge that an Administrative Law Judge of the New York State Public Employment Relations Board in Case No. DR- I 19 (dated May 3, 2007) held that the subject of duty charts, as outlined in I ( d) of Chapter 143 of the V nconsolidated Laws. is a prohibited subject of bargaining.
The City and PBA are appealing that determination and other unions have been granted
permission by PERB to file amicus briefs.

       The parties agree to continue in status quo pending a final and binding decision on that issue by PERB or a court of competent jurisdiction, and aJJ appeals thereto, on the legal challenges to that decision.  In the event the determination  in DR-119 that duty charts are a prohibited subject of bargaining is affirmed, the parties will jointly support legislation to ameliorate the effect of the decision.

If the above conforms to your understanding. please c.'<ecute the -;ignaturc line
fielow.
