8.0 OVERTIME

        8.4 Compensation for Overtime

            A. The preferable method by which overtime shall be compensated is by monetary payment, at one and one-half (11/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay.

            B. Should the Police Chief determine that the best interests of the City will be served thereby, he or his designee may permit an employee to be compensated for overtime work by earning paid compensatory time off at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay. The employee will be credited with time off at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) hours of time for each hour of overtime worked. This time, hereinafter identified as "comp time" will be accrued in a comp time bank for each employee. The hours in this bank shall reflect the converted time value of each hour worked.

                1. Effective January 1, -200§ 2010, employees are limited to the accumulation of 12G 160 hours of comp time. Effective July 1, 2010, employees are limited to the accumulation of 200 hours of comp time.
                2. Beginning July 1, 2011, Twiee a1:1Pil'l9 eaek ealel'laeP ·teElf', eegil'll'lil'lg ApPil 1§ e.l'la el'lail'lg ApPil 3Q Ema eegil'll'lil'lg flJevemeep 15 el'la eF1aiF19 flJevemeep 3Q, each affected employee who has accrued comp time credits, may elect to convert up to fep=t=y (4Q) twenty (20) hours of such accrued time each calendar year
quarter to the cash equivalent thereof, to a maximum of eighty (80) hours per calendar year.

                3. For the period July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, employees paid out of the General Fund of the City agree that compensation to them for overtime earned by them shall be in the form of compensatory time off (comp time) unless and until they have accumulated a maximum of 200 hours of comp
time.   Any accumulation of compensatory time in excess of 200 hours shall be paid in cash.

                4. For the period of  July 1,  2010 to  June 30,  2011,  employees covered by this  Agreement agree to  defer the cash out  of  any comp time.  The cash out  option,  as modified below,  shall be reinstated effective July 1,  2011. The designated periods for cash out shall be September 15 and ending September 30: December 15 and ending December 31: March 15 and
ending March 31: and June 15 and ending June 30.

                5. The  deferral  of  the cash out  option shall not  affect  an employee's  ability to be compensated for all accumulated comp time upon separation from employment with the City.

            C. Use of Comp Time.

                1. When an employee submits a request for time off using accrued compensatory time, and that employee has found a qualified replacement, the time off request will be granted. "Qualified" A qualified replacement means that the replacement officer or employee is able to fulfill therequirements of the position to which the requesting officer is assigned.

                2. When an employee submits a request to take time off using accrued compensatory time and the officer deployment is above minimum staffing for that the requested day, then the request will be granted without further conditions.  However, if  the number of officers scheduled to work on the day(s) of the request is at or below minimum staffing as defined by the department, the compensatory time off request will be
granted only if a qualified replacement has volunteered and committed to work the assignment left open by the request for time off. The volunteer may exchange days off with the requesting employee within the
14-day or 7-day work period, whichever applies, or may elect to receive overtime compensation.

a. For the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, requests under this section will be granted only if the volunteer agrees to exchange days off within the 14 day or 7 day work period, and agrees that he or she will not be subject to payment for overtime as a result of the exchange.

                3. Requests for use of compensatory time off during holidays as defined by the current MOU, must be  submitted  in  time  to  be considered during the monthly scheduling meeting held by bureau and division commanders for the upcoming month. These requests will be considered by seniority and will be granted only if officer deployment is above minimum staffing.

                4. Although it is always preferable for the officer to find a qualified replacement when requesting the use of compensatory time off, if provided sufficient notice of a request for time off, thedepartment will work with employees to find a qualified replacement. Sufficient notice and reasonable period will be defined as follows:

                    a. Seventy-two (72) hours notice for one (1) day or less of time off requested.

                    b. Five (5) calendar days notice for more than one (1) workday up to one
                        (1) workweek.

                    c. Fourteen (14) calendar days notice for more than one (1) week compensatory time off request.

                5. If an employee has provided sufficient notice of a compensatory time off request, the department will work with the employee to find a qualified replacement in the following manner:

                    a. The watch commander will maintain a calendar of time off that has been requested in accordance with the guidelines listed above. Qualified employees will be allowed to volunteer to work these shifts. In the future, the department may develop, at its own discretion, an automated schedule that will contain this information.

                    b. If an employee volunteers and signs up to work for another employee who has requested compensatory time off, that volunteering employee will be held responsible for working that full shift without further reminder. Employees who do not show up to work, or retract their offer to replace another officer, may be subject to disciplinary action
and may not be permitted to volunteer to work in this manner in the future.

                6. The watch commander shall send out an e-mail message to all officers
requesting a volunteer to cover the shift by switching days off or working on overtime.

                7. When a compensatory time off request is made in a manner that does not comply with this policy, and granting that request would unduly disrupt the operations of the department, the department may deny that request.
