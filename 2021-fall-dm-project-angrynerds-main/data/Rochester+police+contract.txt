    13 Department, which is signed by both members involved in the trade, and
    14 submitted to both members' supervisors for approval and signature.

    27 on an unreasonable or arbitrary basis.
    28 8.	Any changing of a member's "R" day(s) as a result of trading time pursuant

    35 member's supervisor. Requests shall be submitted a minimum of seven (7)
    36 days in advance. The supervisor must respond in writing within forty-eight
    37 (48) hours of receipt of the request.	The supervisor shall approve the
    38 request unless approval would unreasonably interfere with the ability to
    39 provide police services. Payment of overtime shall not be the sole factor for
    40 denial of the initial request for compensatory time but may be a factor for
    41 denial of subsequent requests within the same platoon or section.   If the
    42 request is not granted, then the supervisor shall articulate the reason(s) for
    43 the denial.
    44 B.	Requests shalt be considered according to the order in which they were
    45 received, considering the earliest request first.

Section 9:	Distribution of Overtime
    2 Notwithstanding the provisions of General Order 265 pertaining to Special
    3 Events, the parties agree that distribution  of scheduled  overtime within  various
    4 sections or units shall not be arbitrary or capricious.  Members shall not be deprived
    5 of scheduled overtime for disciplinary or punitive reasons or because of exercising
    6 their option of working for compensatory time or cash.
7
    8 If distribution of overtime is grieved and appealed to arbitration, the
    9 Arbitrator shall make his decision based upon fairness to the employees, the
    10 practical application of the scheduled overtime, seniority, and the ability and need of
    11 the Department to fulfill its mission.

    24 member resigned or retired from the Rochester Police Department with the
    25 disciplinary charges pending.   However, a member who retires or resigns
    26 from the Rochester Police Department with disciplinary charges pending
    27 shall have the right within two weeks after leaving the Rochester Police
    28 Department to file a written statement which shall be maintained with the
    29 charges and which shall be disclosed whenever the disciplinary charges are
    30 disclosed. The City shall not disclose to the requesting party records of an
    31 internal investigation that was pending without charges at the time the
    32 member resigned or retired from the Rochester Police Department unless
    33 charges were brought after the member retired or resigned, and said member
    34 was given an opportunity for a name-clearing hearing or to file a written
    35 statement.	Such charges shall be brought within the time for bringing
    36 disciplinary charges against a member of the Department.   The member
    37 shall be allowed two weeks to either request a name-clearing hearing or to
    38 file a written statement. If the member elects to file a written statement, the
    39 statement shall be maintained with the charges and shall be disclosed
    40 whenever the disciplinary charges are disclosed.   If the member elects to
    41 have a name-clearing hearing, the hearing shall be held before a member of
    42 the Rochester Police Department of the rank of Captain or above who is
    43 chosen by the Chief from a list of three names submitted by the former
    44 member. The hearing shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence.
    45 The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Chief, who shall
    46 make the final determination. A transcript shall not be required, but either
    47 party may provide for a transcript at their own cost. The sole issue in such a
    48 hearing shall be whether substantial evidence supports the charges so that
    49 the records can be released to a requesting party.  The hearing shall have no
    50 effect on the former member's status with the Department and shall not
    51 constitute a determination of guilt or innocence on the charges for
    52 disciplinary purposes. The former member may be called as a witness at the
    53 hearing by either party. 54

2.   Any member or former member of the Rochester Police Department shall
    2 have the opportunity to review his or her own history record maintained by
    3 the Professional Standards Section of the Rochester Police Department,
    4 upon written request, at a time and in a manner to be reasonably established
    5 by the Professional Standards Section, provided that nothing contained
    6 herein shall give any member or former member the right to review the
    7 history record of an investigation pending at the time of such review if the
    8 member or former member has not yet been notified of the investigation,
    9 nor the right  to review any record relating to any investigation by the

    27 A.	The City shall pay reasonable and necessary attorney's fees at rates
    28 prevailing in the local legal community, disbursements and litigation
    29 expenses incurred by a police officer in his defense in a criminal
    30 proceeding in a state or federal court arising out of any alleged act or
    31 omission that occurred or allegedly occurred while the employee was
    32 exercising or performing or in good faith purporting to  exercise or
    33 perform his powers and duties.   The police officer shall be entitled to
    34 private counsel of his own choice, except that the Corporation Counsel
    35 may require that appropriate groups of police officers be represented by
    36 the same private counsel.   This duty to pay for a defense in a criminal
    37 proceeding shall arise only upon the complete acquittal of a police
    38 officer, the dismissal of all criminal charges against him, or a no-bill by a
    39 Grand Jury investigating an on-duty use of a weapon. Attorney's fees,
    40 disbursements, and litigation expenses shall be submitted by the attorney
    41 within 30 days after acquittal or dismissal to the Corporation Counsel in
    42 the manner and form required by him, and shall be reviewed and
    43 approved by him prior to payment.
44
    45 B.	The City shall provide for the defense of a police officer in any civil
    46 action or proceeding before any state or federal court or administrative
    47 agency arising out of any alleged act or  omission that occurred or
    48 allegedly occurred while the police officer was exercising or performing
    49 or in good faith purporting to exercise or perform his powers and duties.
    50 This duty to provide for a defense shall not arise where the action or
    51 proceeding is brought by or at the behest of the City itself unless the
    52 police officer is successful in such action or proceeding.
53
    54 C.	The Corporation Counsel shall defend, or may employ special counsel to
    55 defend, the police officer in any civil action or proceeding unless the
    56 Corporation Counsel determines that a conflict of interest exists or may

arise in which case the police officer shall be entitled to private counsel
    2 of his choice, except that the Corporation Counsel may require that
    3 appropriate groups of police officers be represented by the same private
    4 counsel. If special counsel is employed, or a police officer is represented
    5 by private counsel, the City shall pay reasonable and necessary attorney's
    6 fees at rates prevailing in the local legal community, disbursements, and
    7 litigation expenses incurred by a police officer in his defense. Attorney's
    8 fees, disbursements and litigation expenses shall be submitted by the
    9 attorney promptly after the end of each month to the Corporation
    10 Counsel, in the manner and form required by him, and shall be reviewed
    11 and approved by him prior to payment. 12
    13 D.	The City shall indemnify and save harmless a police officer in the
    14 amount of any judgment obtained against the police officer in a state or
    15 federal court or administrative agency, or in the amount of any settlement
    16 or a claim, provided that the act or omission occurred while the police
    17 officer was exercising or performing or in good faith purporting to
    18 exercise or perform his powers and duties. This duty to indemnify and
    19 save harmless shall not arise where the injury or damage resulted from
    20 intentional wrongdoing on the part of the police officer; nor shall it arise
    21 where a judgment is obtained or claim settled as a result of an action or
    22 proceeding brought by or at the behest of the City itself; nor shall it arise
    23 with respect to non-automatic punitive or exemplary damages, fines or
    24 penalties.
25
    26 E.	The duties to pay for or to provide a defense and to indemnify and save
    27 harmless shall be conditioned upon (a) delivery by a police officer to the
    28 Corporation Counsel of any notice, summons, complaint or any other
    29 legal process within five (5) business days after he is served with such
    30 document, and (b) the full cooperation of a police officer in the defense
    31 of any action or proceeding against him or against the City based upon
    32 his alleged acts or omissions, and in the taking of any appeals.
33
    34 F.	Any dispute arising under this Section shall be submitted to arbitration
    35 pursuant to Article 27, Section 4, of this Agreement.	A demand for
    36 arbitration must be served within sixty (60) days of written notice to the
    37 Club of a decision by the Corporation Counsel.
38
    39 Section 9:	Chiefs Award Day

        3 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
        4 BETWEEN
        5 THE CITY OF ROCHESTER
        6 AND
        7 ROCHESTER POLICE LOCUST CLUB, INC.
        8 Whereas the City of Rochester and the Rochester Police Locust Club,
        9 Inc. have been participating in a joint Labor/Management Health Care
        10 Committee and mutually agree to a single health insurance provider
        11 which will eliminate the current health insurance plans as
        12 referenced in the current collective bargaining agreement and
        13 replace them with the Value, Core, and Enhanced plans of benefits as
        14 developed by the joint committee:

        15 Therefore the parties mutually agree to the following:

        16 I.	This agreement is a successor to the Memorandum of
11	Agreement that was in effect from September 1, 2009
    18 through August 31, 2012 and this MOA will become an
    19 appendix to the collective bargaining agreement. The
    20 effective period for this Agreement is January 1, 2013
    21 through December 31, 2015.

    22 II. Modify the Health Insurance provisions (Article 11) of the
    23 collective bargaining agreement as follows:

    24 ARTICLE 11- HOSPITAL & SURGICAL INSURANCE & DEATH
    25 BENEFITS
    26 Section 1:	Hospital and Surgical Health Benefits
21	A. The City shall make available to unit members - the Value,
    28 Core,  and  Enhanced  plans  which  may  be  amended  or
    29 eliminated during the term of this agreement as determined
    30 by the Labor/Management Health Care Committee.
31
    32 B. It is expressly understood by the parties that a unit member
    33 married to another unit member shall be eligible for only one
    34 single health insurance contract in the event his or her
    35 spouse is covered by his or her own single health insurance
    36 contract, and further, that such member shall not be eligible
    37 for any separate health insurance coverage if his or her
    38 spouse is covered by a family health insurance contract, as
    39 provided for in this Section.
40

    1 C. The Parties will continue to participate on the joint Labor/
    2 Management Health Care Committee. The parties will make
    3 a good faith commitment to fulfill the responsibilities of this
    4 Committee throughout the term of this Agreement.
5
6
7
8	Section 2:	Self Funding and the City's Defined Contribution
9
A
Effective January 1, 2013, the City will change from a fully
10

insured indemnity funding arrangement for its health
11

insurance program to a self-insured funding arrangement.
12


13
B.
For Plan year 2013 (January 1, 2013 through December 31,
14

2013) the City will make a defined contribution in the amount
15

of $35,913,280.00 toward the funding of the City's Health
16

Insurance Program for all active City employees. This total
17

amount of the City's defined contribution is based on the
18

following calculation: $14,240.00 per contract for all active
19

City employees multiplied by 2,522 contracts.
20


21
C.
For Plan year 2014 (January 1, 2014 through December 31,
22

2014) the City will increase its 2013 defined contribution
23

amount by 3.75%, which equates to $14,774.00 multiplied by
24

the number of contracts as of September 1, 2013 for all active
25

City employees.
26


21
D.
For Plan year 2015 (January 1, 2015 through December 31,
28

2015) the City will increase its 2014 defined contribution
29

amount by 3.75%, which equates to $15,328.00 multiplied by
30

the number of contracts as of September 1, 2014 for all active
31

City employees.
32


33
E.
The labor/Management Health Care Committee will have the
34

responsibility for determining how any differential in the
35

amount of City defined contribution funding and the total
36

annual cost of health care for active employees will be
37

reconciled in accordance with the labor/Management Health
38

Care Committee Governance Agreement. It is understood
39

that the Committee must take action to reach consensus on
40

this funding reconciliation by September 30th of any plan
41

year, so as not to disrupt open enrollment or adversely affect
42

employee coverage.
43



Section 3:	Alternative Plans
    2 Unit members, who accept health insurance coverage from a
    3 source other than the City of Rochester shall receive $1,500 per
    4 annum, prorated by month, based on the Health Insurance Plan year,
    5 payable no later than 60 days following the end of the preceding Plan
    6 year, if 1 through 49 unit members accept this option. If, however, 50
1	to 59 unit members accept this option by the last day of the Plan year,
    8 the payment shall increase to $2,000 per annum per unit member. If
    9 60 or more unit members accept this option by the last day of the Plan
JO	year, the payment shall increase to $2,500 per annum per member.
11
    12 Applications shall be made for the following Plan year at the
    13 same time as "open enrollment" for health insurance.
14
    15 Re-enrollment in City coverage is permitted during the year if a
    16 qualifying event occurs.
17

    18 Section 4:	Dependent Coverage
    19 In the event of the line-of-duty death of any active member of the
    20 unit, the City will continue to provide and pay the cost of all health
    21 benefits provided by this Article to the surviving spouse of the
    22 deceased member until said spouse dies or remarries, and to
    23 dependent children of the deceased member until such dependents
