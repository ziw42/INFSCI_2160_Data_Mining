32 5.	It is intended by the provisions of this Agreement that there be no abrogation of the duties,

1 obligations, or responsibilities of any agency or department of City government which is
2 now expressly provided for respectively either by: State Statute and Charter Ordinances
3 of the City of Milwaukee except as expressly limited herein.
4 6. It is intended by the parties hereto that the employer-employee relationship which exists
5 now and has heretofore existed by and between the City and the members of the
6 Association who are employed by the City shall continue to be the same in the event this
7 Agreement is terminated or by virtue of its terms becomes terminated.

12 unless the parties hereto both agree to extend it beyond that date.
13 2.	Not earlier than June 15, 2012, nor later than July 1, 2012, the Association shall give the

22 FURTHER BARGAINING Article of this Agreement.

5 Agreement are created by the City through action of the Common Council and said
6 positions would be embraced within the bargaining unit, provided the City and
7 Association agree that the new positions(s) should be embraced within the bargaining unit,
8 then the employees appointed to such positions shall be deemed part of such bargaining
9 unit and shall be represented by the bargaining unit and they shall also be covered by the
10 Agreement between the Association and the City.

18 consent thereto. In the event of differences between this Agreement and ordinances and
19 resolutions, this Agreement shall control.

1 enter into immediate collective bargaining negotiations for the purpose of arriving at mutually
2 satisfactory modifications to Article 7 only.
3 I.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
4 A.	GRIEVANCES
5 1.	Differences involving the interpretation, application or enforcement of the
6 provisions of this Agreement or the application of a rule or regulation of the
7 Milwaukee Police Department affecting wages, hours, or conditions of
8 employment shall constitute a grievance under the provisions set forth
9 below. Matters of departmental discipline involving application of the rules
10 or regulations of the Milwaukee Police Department which are not subject to
11 appeal to the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, shall constitute a
12 grievance under the aforementioned provisions and matters of departmental
13 discipline involving application of the rules or regulations of the Chief of
14 Police which are subject to appeal to the Board of Fire and Police
15 Commissioners shall not constitute a grievance under the aforementioned
16 provisions.	Matters involving approval of medical (or dental) insurance
17 claims filed by an employee, or medical (or dental) insurance claims filed
18 by an employee on behalf of his/her dependents, shall not constitute a
19 grievance under the aforementioned provisions.
20 Obligations of the City under Chapter 65, Wisconsin Statutes, and any
21 pension matter under the exclusive jurisdiction or control of any duly
22 constituted pension board shall not constitute a grievance under the
23 provisions aforementioned.
24 2.	Grievances over discipline shall be initiated at the level of the Grievance
25 Procedure immediately above the level of the chain of command at which
26 the discipline was administered, except that in cases of discipline
27 administered by the Chief of Police the grievance shall be initiated at step 2

1 of the Grievance Procedure and be reviewed by the Chief of Police.
2 3.	Steps 1 and 2, inclusive, of this Grievance Procedure shall be inapplicable
3 to grievances involving health and life insurance benefits.	A grievance
4 concerning health insurance or life insurance benefits, other than a matter
5 involving claims, shall be submitted directly to the City Labor Negotiator
6 for review within fifteen (15) calendar days of the occurrence of the
7 incident leading to such grievance.	Within fifteen (15) calendar days
8 following receipt of such grievance by the City Labor Negotiator,
9 representatives of the MPA shall meet with the City Labor Negotiator, or
10 his/her designee, at a mutually convenient time and place in an attempt to
11 resolve the grievance. Following such meeting, the City Labor Negotiator
12 shall answer the grievance in writing setting forth the reasons for his/her
13 decision and submit same to the Association Grievance Committee
14 Chairman within twenty-five (25) calendar days of such meeting. If the
15 grievance is not settled, the Association may proceed to final and binding
16 arbitration as hereinafter provided.
17 4.	All grievances and grievance appeals shall set forth the provision of the
18 Agreement and/or the rule or regulation of the Chief of Police under which
19 the grievance was filed. All appeals of duly filed grievances not submitted
20 by the Association or employee (hereinafter referred to as "member")
21 within the time limit specified shall be termed abandoned grievances and as
22 such shall be considered as being resolved in favor of the City and not
23 subject to   provisions   of   this   GRIEVANCE   AND   ARBITRATION
24 PROCEDURE. By mutual agreement, the parties may waive any of the
25 steps	contained	in	this	GRIEVANCE	AND	ARBITRATION
26 PROCEDURE.	With the consent of the Association, the City Labor
27 Negotiator may waive any of the steps contained in this GRIEVANCE

1 AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE for grievances involving economic
2 matters; this waiver provision shall not apply to grievances over matters of
3 Departmental discipline.
4 5.	In the event the Chief or Department takes a particular action which, in the
5 Association's view, results in a violation of the agreement and such action
6 adversely affects a number of members under circumstances that are
7 essentially identical, the MPA grievance committee may file a group
8 grievance on their behalf at the second step, within 15 calendar days of the
9 occurrence of the incident leading to such grievance. The group grievance
10 shall identify by name, all members alleged to have been adversely affected
11 by such action. If the MPA grievance committee is unable to identify all
12 members of the group, by name, within the time limit allowed for the filing
13 of grievances, it shall specify those facts which cause the adversely affected
14 members to be identically situated in its view. Before responding to the
15 grievance, the Department shall provide the Association with information
16 or access to information reasonably necessary for the Association to
17 identify the members covered by the group grievance.	The Association
18 must identify all members covered by the group grievance before appealing
19 it to arbitration. Alleged violations occurring after the occurrence of the
20 incident giving rise to the group grievance shall not be considered to be
21 covered by the group grievance, even if the facts are alleged to be
22 essentially identical.	In such a case, separate grievances or group
23 grievances must be timely filed in order to be considered. Nothing herein is
24 intended to preclude the parties from agreeing to consolidate grievances and
25 group grievances for purposes of arbitration.
26 B.	STEPS IN THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
27 STEP 1:

1 The aggrieved member shall reduce his/her grievance to writing on a
2 provided numbered form and shall present such written grievance to his/her
3 Association Steward. The Association Steward shall meet with the grievant
4 and if the grievant so desires and the Association Steward so determines,
5 the Association Steward shall present the written grievance to the grievant's
6 district or bureau commanding officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of
7 the occurrence of the incident leading to the grievance.	Thereafter, the
8 grievant, his/her Association Steward and his/her district or bureau
9 commanding officer together with the grievant's immediate supervisor shall
10 meet and discuss the grievance in a friendly manner and shall make every
11 effort to resolve the grievance. The district or bureau commanding officer,
12 if he/she deems it appropriate, may also discuss the grievance with the
13 grievant's shift commander and may include him/her in the meeting.
14 Following said meeting, the district or bureau commanding officer in
15 consultation with the grievant's shift commander and immediate supervisor
16 shall answer  the grievance  in writing, setting forth the  reasons for  his
17 decision and submit same to the Association Steward and the aggrieved
18 within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance.
19 STEP 2
20 If the grievance is not resolved in step 1 above, the MPA Grievance
21 Committee Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the
22 MPA bargaining unit, may within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt
23 of the Step 1 decision appeal this decision to the Chief of Police. Failure to
24 appeal said decision within said period of time shall constitute a settlement
25 of the grievance. Said appeal shall be in writing and shall be submitted to
26 the Chief of Police and therein a request shall be made for a meeting with
27 the Chief of Police to consider the decision from Step 1.	The Chief of

1 Police and the Chief's Panel together with the MPA Grievance Committee
2 Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the MPA
3 bargaining unit, shall meet at a mutually agreeable time. The grievant shall
4 be entitled to be present at such appeal meeting and shall have the right to
5 be represented by the Grievance Committee Chairman, or his/her designee
6 who shall be a member of the MPA bargaining unit, and the parties shall
7 discuss the Step 1 decision in good faith and attempt to resolve the matter.
8 Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written appeal to the
9 grievance, unless the time period is mutually extended by the parties, the
10 Chief shall, in writing, advise the Chairman of the MPA Grievance
11 Committee and the grievant as to the Chief's decision with respect to the
12 grievance. If an Association grievance is not settled at the second step, the
13 Association may proceed to final and binding  arbitration as  hereinafter
14 provided.
15 II. GRIEVANCE ARBITRATION
16 A.	Final and binding arbitration may be initiated by serving upon the Chief of Police
17 and City Labor Negotiator a notice in writing of an intent to proceed to final and
18 binding arbitration within 30 calendar days of receipt of the second step answer.
19 Said notice shall identify the grievance and the employees involved.
20 B.
21 Unless the parties can, within seven (7) calendar days following the receipt of such
22 written notice, agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, either party may in writing
23 request the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission to submit a list of five
24 (5) arbitrators to both parties. The parties shall, within seven (7) calendar days of
25 the receipt of said list, select the arbitrator by alternately striking names from the
26 list until one name remains. Such person shall then become the arbitrator.
27 C.	The arbitrator shall hold hearings at a time convenient to the parties, with the

1 location of such hearings alternating between the MPA offices and the offices of
2 the City Hall complex.	The arbitrator shall take such evidence as  in his/her
3 judgment is appropriate for the disposition of the dispute. Statements of position
4	may be made by the parties and witnesses may be called. In disputes involving
5 application of rules or regulations of the Milwaukee Police Department, the Chief
6 of Police or his or her representative shall be permitted to participate in the
7 proceeding and to state the Department's position on the dispute.
8 D.	The arbitrator shall neither add to, detract from, nor modify the language of the
9 Agreement or of the rules and regulations in arriving at a determination of any
10 issue presented that is proper for final and binding arbitration within the limitations
11 expressed herein. The arbitrator shall have no authority to grant wage increases or
12 wage decreases.
13 E.	The arbitrator shall expressly confine himself/herself to the precise issues
14 submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to determine any other issue
15 not so submitted to him/her or to submit observations or declarations of opinion
16 which are not directly essential in reaching the determination.

4 Agreement at the close of the calendar year who has completed at least ten (10) years of
5 service but less than fifteen (15) years of service as of that time shall be eligible to receive
6 $300, each employee covered by this Agreement at the close of the calendar year who has
7 completed at least fifteen (15) years of service but less than twenty (20) years of service as
8 of that time shall be eligible to receive $550, and	each employee covered by this
9 Agreement at the close of the calendar year who has completed twenty (20) or more years
10 of service as of that time shall be eligible to receive $900. An employee's "years of
11 service," as used herein, shall mean his/her active service as a member of the WERC-
12 certified bargaining unit   represented   by the   Association   or   its   predecessor,   the
13 Professional Policemen's Protective Association.
14 2.	Except as provided in subsection 3 of this Article, below, payments earned under these
15 provisions shall be made as soon as is administratively practicable after December 31.
16 3.	An employee retiring on normal pension, or resigning voluntarily from the Police
17 Department shall be entitled to the benefits provided by subsection 1 of this Article,
18 above, prorated on the basis of his/her active service in the calendar year he/she retired,
19 computed to the nearest calendar month. For purposes of prorating, an employee on the
20 Police Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as
21 having been on the payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is on the
22 Police Department payroll less than 14 days in a calendar month, then the employee shall
23 be deemed as not having been on the payroll at all during the calendar month.	For
24 purposes of determining eligibility for the benefits provided in subsection 1, above, years
25 of service shall be computed as of the effective date of the employee's normal retirement
26 or voluntary resignation.	Payments earned hereunder shall be made as soon as is
27 administratively practicable after the employee's retirement or voluntary resignation; the

1 employee contribution required under subsection 5.b., below, shall be deducted from these
2 payments. All other provisions of this Article shall apply unchanged.

7 their Longevity Pay benefits included in final average salary for purposes of computing
8 their service retirement allowance. For purposes of interpretation and construction of the
9 provisions of this Article:
10 a.	The Longevity Pay benefit to which the employee is entitled to include in the Final
11 Average Salary computation shall be an amount equal to the Longevity Pay
12 payment the employee received for December 31 of the calendar year immediately
13 preceding the employee's effective date of retirement.  For such employees who
14 retire after December 31, 1997, and who have attained 20 years or more of service
15 by the end of the calendar year which includes their effective date of retirement,
16 that amount shall be the longevity pay payment the employee would have received
17 had he or she remained in active service for the calendar year which includes his or
18 her effective date of retirement.
19 b.	Employees shall be required to contribute to their respective City pension funds
20 $1.00 of the Longevity Pay payment they received for that year. The contribution
21 shall be a payroll deduction made at the time the payment is made.
22 6.	Employees in active service shall have time spent receiving a duty disability retirement
23 allowance counted as active service for purposes of computing current and prospective
24 longevity benefits.
25 7.	An employee who is on detached status under the Contract Administration provisions of
26 this Agreement or an employee who has returned to active duty from detached status
27 under the Contract Administration provisions of this Agreement, or a prior Agreement

1 between the City and the Association, shall be entitled to these benefits under the terms
2 and conditions set forth if the combination of his/her "years of service," as defined in
3 paragraph 1., hereof, and his/her service in detached status establish eligibility therefore.
4 8.	An employee on a military leave of absence for performance of duty as a member of the
5 State of Wisconsin National Guard or a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the
6 United States shall be eligible for Longevity Pay benefits for a calendar year prorated on
7 the basis of the employee's active service with the Department in that calendar year
8 subject to the following:
9 a.	The military leave is a result of being called to, or volunteering for, active duty
10 under the authority granted to the President of the United States or the Congress of
11 the United States for a period of more than 30 calendar days;
12 b.	The length of service requirements provided in section 1., above, shall determine
13 the amount of Longevity Pay benefits to which the employee is entitled;
14 c.	Length of service shall be calculated as of the effective date the employee
15 separated from active service with the Department and began his/her unpaid
16 military leave of absence.
17 d.	For purposes of prorating Longevity Pay benefits, an employee on the Police
18 Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as
19 having been on the payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is
20 on the Police Department payroll less that 14 days in a calendar month, then the

5 assigned or continue to be assigned by the Chief to the Communication Operations

12 3.	Any payment made under the provisions of this Article shall not have any sum deducted
13 for pension benefits nor shall such payments be included in the determination of pension

22 responsibilities associated with winter storage of the officer's assigned motorcycle. Such
23 duties shall be prescribed by the Chief of Police, who may, from time to time, change
24 them. The duties shall include, but not be limited to, frequent visual inspection, periodic
25 recharging of the motorcycle's battery, performing the prescribed shut down procedure at
26 the beginning of winter storage and a start-up procedure at the end of winter storage and

6 period of winter storage shall be determined by the Chief of Police.
7 3.	For the duration of the winter storage period, an officer who maintains his/her assigned
8 motorcycle in an approved private storage area shall receive $20.00 biweekly in addition
9 to base salary in lieu of any other compensation for the duties (and the expected amount of
10 time devoted to those duties) described in sections 1 and 2, above.
11 4.	Except as modified by sections 1 through 3, all heretofore existing administrative
12 procedures associated with the $20.00 biweekly payments received by employees
13 assigned to motorcycle traffic patrol duty shall remain unchanged.
14 5.	Winter storage of City motorcycles and compensation therefore, as set forth in sections 1
15 through 4, may be terminated at any time at the sole discretion of the Chief of Police.


16 ARTICLE 14

17 HOURS OF WORK
18 1. The normal hours of work for employees covered by this Agreement shall consist of work
19 shifts of eight (8) consecutive hours which in the aggregate results in an average normal
20 work week of forty (40) hours.
21 2. Within the normal hours of work, any shift assignment of eight consecutive hours, which
22 is of 10 consecutive eight-hour work shifts in duration or longer, with each eight-hour
23 work shift starting at the same time or in the case of special assignments such as vice-
24 squad with possible differing starting times for each eight-hour work shift shall be deemed
25 to be a regularly scheduled eight-hour shift assignment; except that within the normal
26 hours of work Christmas Store detail or Summerfest detail shall also constitute a regularly

1 scheduled eight-hour shift assignment.	The regularly scheduled eight-hour shift
2 assignment of employees assigned to the Professional Performance Division (PPD) who
3 perform duties traditionally performed by PPD, including criminal investigations of
4 department members and investigations of claims to which the department is a party, shall
5 be established in the same manner as that of employees assigned to the vice-squad as
6 stated above.
7 3.	The regularly scheduled eight-hour shift shall be established by the Chief of Police in
8 accordance with the requirements set forth above.
9 4.	Except on those occasions when an emergency situation exists, if the Department desires
10 to change the off days falling within a single pay period for a member who otherwise
11 continues to be assigned to the same schedule and off day group, the member must be
12 given personal notice of such change, at least seven days prior to the start of the pay
13 period in question. If the Department fails to give such notice, all hours worked on either
14 of the off days in question shall be treated as falling outside the regularly scheduled eight-
15 hour shift, as provided in Article 15


16 ARTICLE 15

17 OVERTIME
18 1.	DEFINITION:

19 Overtime shall be all authorized assignments outside the regularly scheduled eight-hour
20 shift as hereinbefore defined under the Article "Hours of Work." Notwithstanding the
21 fact that trade off of work assignments or other rescheduling of work assignments
22 authorized by the Department at the request of the employee results in work assignments
23 outside of the regularly scheduled eight-hour shift, such time shall not be considered
24 overtime.
25
26	2.	OVERTIME RATES

1 a.	Overtime earned as a result of training time or roll-call time shall be compensated

2 for at base salary rates (1X).

10 completing the two and one-half (21/2) hour minimum.

11 (2)	Each court appearance greater than two and one-half (21/2) hours in

12 duration shall be compensated at one and one-half base salary rates (11/2X)

14 (3)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, within any court appearance, the first hour

15 of court-ordered lunch time shall be unpaid.

16 (4)	Parking During Court Overtime Appearance

17 Subject to the following terms and conditions, the City will provide

18 employees with City-paid parking at MacArthur Square parking facility

19 (located at 841 N. James Lovell Street) when they are on authorized Police

20 Department business during off-duty hours as a result of either a court

21 overtime   assignment   or   when	ordered	to the   Police   Department

22 Administration Building by a commanding officer:

23 (a)	If the MacArthur Square parking facility has no available parking

1 space, the City will honor parking receipts from the MATC

2 parking facility.

4 i.	Court Overtime

5 The duration of the employee's court overtime appearance

6 beginning at the time the employee is required to be in

7 court, ending at the time the employee is released by the

8 court and including a reasonable amount of time for the

9 employee to get to and from his/her parked vehicle. An

10 employee assigned to the early shift on a regular basis who

11 receives City-paid parking hereunder as a result of a court

12 appearance during his/her off-duty hours shall also be

13 entitled to an extension of such parking until the end of

14 his/her assignment on that date if he/she is assigned to early

15 shift duty on that date and the conclusion of the court

16 appearance falls within two hours of the start of his/her

17 shift.

18 ii.	Authorized	Departmental	Business	at	Police

19 Administration Building

20 The duration of the employee's appearance at the Police

21 Administration	Building	beginning	at	the	time	the

1 reasonable amount of time for the employee to get to and

2 from his/her parked vehicle.

3 (c)	In order to receive City-paid parking benefits, the employee shall,

4 immediately following the conclusion of a court appearance,

5 present the court overtime time card for that appearance and the

6 designated parking facility receipt covering the time period of the

7 appearance to a supervisory police officer designated by the Police

8 Department Administration. The overtime card shall indicate the

9 duration of the court appearance. Based on the overtime card, the

10 designated supervisory officer shall authorize the payment of the

11 parking fee to cover the time period of the court appearance and a

12 reasonable amount of time for the employee to get to and from

13 his/her vehicle and the court. The time allowed to get to and from

14 the employee's parked vehicle and the court shall be the same as in

15 provided in Departmental  Order #8947, adopted November 27,

16 1984. This Order provides that each instance of City-paid parking

17 shall be limited to the duration of the employees' court overtime

18 appearance and include actual time up to 30 minutes prior to the

19 start of the court overtime and no more than 30 minutes after the

20 conclusion of the court overtime.	City-paid parking benefits

21 associated	with	an	employee's	appearance	at	the	Police

22 Department Administration Building during off-duty hours on

23 authorized	Departmental	business	pursuant	to	order	of	a

1 commanding officer shall be administered in accordance with

2 procedures established for that purpose by the Police Department

3 Administration.

4 (d)	The City shall be held harmless against any and all claims, actions

5 and lawsuits relating to theft or personal property damage brought

6 against the City by employees using parking facilities pursuant to

7 the parking allowance benefits provided herein. The City shall be

8 held harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, actions,

9 damages and judgments due to the employee's operation of his or

10 her private vehicle at parking facilities which are subject to the

11 parking allowance benefits provided herein. Nothing herein would

12 operate to relieve the City of any liability it may have arising from

13 its actions or omissions or preclude the employee from pursuing

14 any rights or claims he/she may have under Wisconsin State

15 Statute 895.46.

16 c.	Overtime earned as a result of an authorized eight-hour shift assignment which
17 falls outside the regularly scheduled eight-hour shift in whole or in part and which
18 because of the nature of the work performed does not fall within 2.a. or 2.b.,
19 above, shall be compensated at one and one-half (11/2X) the base salary rate,
20 except that if an employee's regularly scheduled eight-hour shift, as established
21 by the HOURS OF WORK provision of this Agreement, is changed, then all time
22 worked on the new regularly scheduled eight-hour shift shall be compensated at
23 (1X) the base salary rate.
24 d.	Overtime earned as a result of an authorized assignment outside of the regularly

1 scheduled shift which does not fall within 2.a., 2.b. or 2.c., above, shall be
2 compensated at one and one-half (11/2X) the base salary.
3 3.	OVERTIME PAYMENTS
4 a.	Definitions
5 (1)	Compensatory Time Off Balance (CTB)
6 The term "compensatory time off balance (CTB)", as used in subsection 3
7 of this Article, shall mean the unused amount of overtime the employee has
8 earned that was compensated in time off instead of cash.
9 (2)	Overtime Earned
10 The term "overtime earned," as used in subsection 3 of this Article, shall
11 mean the amount of overtime worked times the rate at which it is
12 compensated; for   example,   one   hour   of   overtime   worked   that   is
13 compensated at straight time rates (1X)*1 under this Article shall equal one
14 hour of overtime earned and one hour of overtime worked that is
15 compensated at a rate of time and one-half (11/2X) under this Article shall
16 equal 11/2 hours of overtime earned.
17 b.	Payment
18 All overtime earned for work performed during the term of this Agreement, shall
19 be paid for in cash except that:
20 (1)	If an employee's compensatory time off balance (CTB) recorded on the
21 most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is less than 225
22 hours, the employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of
23 cash for each instance of overtime work performed after issuance of the
24 most current Status Report until issuance of the next Status Report which
25 indicates the employee's CTB is equal to or greater than 225 hours.

1 *Less than two and one half hours of Court Overtime worked shall equal two and one half hours of overtime earned at 1.5X Base Salary.

1 (2)	An employee may use compensatory time off on dates he/she has requested
2 provided the employee gives his/her commanding officer reasonable
3 advance notice of the dates requested and the dates are determined
4 available by the commanding officer in accordance with the needs of the
5 Police Service. The processing of requests for use of compensatory time
6 off shall be on a first-come, first-served basis.	Decisions made by the
7 employee's commanding officer with respect to the availability of the
8 dates the employee has requested shall be subject to all of the provisions
9 of subsections 3.b. (3) and (4).
10 (3)	The parties recognize and shall implement the U.S. Department of Labor's
11 position that prior to denying a request to use accrued compensatory time,
12 and even when granting the request would bring operations below
13 prescribed staffing levels, an employer must first attempt operational
14 alternatives to fill its prescribed staffing levels by using replacement
15 officers  at premium overtime rates when required by the FLSA.
16 Accordingly, the City, working with and through the Milwaukee Police
17 Association, has established a system which guarantees that no one is
18 denied compensatory time off when prescribed staffing levels can be met
19 through a replacement (paid at FLSA premium rates where they apply). If
20 a police officer is denied a request to use compensatory time on the
21 regularly scheduled shift that the officer has requested, whether on the
22 basis of prescribed staffing levels or for any other reason(s), the provisions
23 enumerated as subsections (a) through (k) at the end of this paragraph will
24 be utilized in order to obtain, when at all possible, a suitable replacement
25 for the officer, excepting under the following circumstances in which the
26 below-described duties fall within the officer's regularly scheduled shift:
27 (aa)	where that police officer is required to testify at a hearing, trial, or

1 other proceeding on behalf of the City (including, inter alia, Fire
2 and Police Commission meetings or hearings, grievance arbitrations,
3 or lawsuits) to the exclusion of any other police officer, and where
4 he or she has not been subpoenaed to testify;
5 (bb)	where a police officer is mandated to appear at a charging
6 conference in the office of the District Attorney, or before any other
7 public prosecutor, and where his or her involvement in the arrest or
8 other pertinent events mandates that the police officer appear to the
9 exclusion of any other police officer; and
10 (cc)	in those circumstances where the police officer (excluding those
11 assigned to the Patrol Bureau and excepting those police officers
12 assigned to the Patrol Support Division), possesses unique technical
13 skills which are required to be made available to the Police
14 Department during a particular period of time. In the event that an
15 officer is denied compensatory time off (or is initially granted
16 compensatory time off and is subsequently denied) under this
17 subsection (cc), s/he shall be compensated at the rate of 1-1/2x (or
18 2x if cancelled within 24 hours of the start of the compensatory time
19 previously	granted)	for	all	hours	of	that	shift	for	which
20 compensatory time off   had   been   requested   if   the   following
21 conditions are satisfied prior to notification by the Department that
22 s/he would be required to work during that time:
23 1. the officer made arrangements for a replacement; and
24 2. both the officer requesting compensatory time off and the
25 replacement executed and filed with the Department the forms
26 specified in Article 15 Section 3.b.(3)(l), of this paragraph,
27 below.

1 The Chief of Police shall develop a form, which will be posted at each work
2 location throughout the Police Department, upon which employees seeking
3 replacements may identify themselves and the pertinent date(s).	The
4 availability of this form shall not preclude the use of replacements obtained
5 by police officers through other means. The following conditions will apply
6 to replacements obtained under this subsection.	If these conditions are
7 fulfilled, the replacement will work in place of the employee who has
8 requested the use of compensatory time off and that request shall be
9 granted.
10 (a)	Arrangements for a replacement must be made and confirmed at

11 least 48 hours in advance of the start of the compensatory time

12 which is to be taken off.

13 (b)	The replacement worker is within the same "box" as shown on the

14 "Milwaukee Police Department Organizational Chart" attached

15 hereto as page 1 of Appendix G (as may be in effect, modified or

16 changed from time to time by the Department or the Fire and

17 Police Commission) as the employee exercising his/her right to use

18 compensatory time off, except as specifically provided on page 2

19 of Appendix G or unless the employee's commanding officer in his

20 or her discretion approves a replacement obtained by the employee

21 from a different "box." In the event that the Department or the

22 Fire and Police Commission modifies the organizational chart, the

23 parties will immediately engage in collective bargaining to provide

24 for reasonably comparable access to replacement workers.

1 (c)	The replacement must have more than one (1) year of service from

2 date of hire and must have completed field training.

3 (d)	The replacement must be of the same rank as the employee

4 requesting use of compensatory time off.

5 (e)	The replacement will be permitted to work as a replacement only

6 on a day when he/she would otherwise be on a regular day off.

7 (f)	An employee is ineligible to work as a replacement for more than

8 two (2) regular off days in a pay period.

9 (g)	An employee is ineligible to work as a replacement for more than

10 four (4) hours during a shift that immediately precedes or follows

11 that employee's regular work shift, not to exceed two (2) occasions

12 per pay period. However, if, because of staggered shifts, the shift

13 of the officer who is being replaced ends or begins one hour before

14 or after the shift of the replacement officer, such shift shall be

15 deemed to "immediately" precede or follow the replacement's

16 regular work shift. When this occurs, the replacement shall work

17 the one-hour of gap (for a maximum of five (5) hours work), which

18 gap time shall be compensated as if it was regular replacement

19 time, as specified in subsection (h), immediately below.

20 (h)	The regular shift replacement hours will be compensated in cash at

21 straight-time (1X) rates (except for the four (4) contractual

22 holidays specified at Article 32 paragraph 1 of this Agreement

23 which will be paid at 11/2X Base Salary).	Time worked as a

1 replacement under this subsection shall be counted as "hours

2 worked" for FLSA purposes, so long as the requirements of the

3 FLSA apply to the City.

4 (i)	The replacement will not receive out-of-shift premium.

5 (j)	The replacement shall be subject to all of the obligations applicable

6 to any employee who is regularly scheduled for duty.

7 (k)	If the replacement reports sick on a day when he/she is scheduled

8 to work as a replacement, he/she will be ineligible thereafter to

9 work as a replacement for a period of 90 days. If the replacement

10 reports injured off-duty on a day when he/she is scheduled to work

11 as a replacement, the replacement will be ineligible thereafter to

12 work as a replacement for a period of 90 days unless: (1) the off-

13 duty injury occurred subsequent to the time at which the

14 replacement agreed   to   serve in   that   capacity;   and   (2)   the

15 replacement provides medical substantiation of the off-duty injury.

16 (l)	A replacement will, at the time of his/her selection, execute on a

17 form prescribed by the Chief of Police his/her agreement to serve

18 as a replacement in accordance with the terms and conditions of

19 this Agreement.	The officer taking compensatory time off who

20 arranged for the replacement will also execute this form.

21 (4)	An officer, at his/her option and under preexisting practices, may also seek a

22 "body-for-body" trade as allowable under 29 C.F.R. § 553.31 ("Substitution") in

23 order to use compensatory time off when desired. This shall not be a prerequisite

1 to the procedure set forth in subsection 3.b.(2) and (3) for obtaining a

2 replacement.

3 c.	Compensatory Time Off Segments

4 (1)	Subject to the terms and conditions provided for in subsection 3.b.(2) of

5 this Article, above, and except as provided in 3.c.(2), below, an employee

6 authorized to use earned compensatory time off must use it in units of

7 either eight-hour days or four-hour segments.

8 (2)	Subject to the terms and conditions provided for in subsection 3.b.(2) of

9 this Article, above, an employee may request to use earned compensatory

10 time off in units of one (1) hour for purposes of significant personal

11 importance.	Such requests will be granted at the discretion of the

12 supervisor consistent with the needs of the service and shall not be denied

13 arbitrarily or capriciously. It is understood that the needs of the service

14 are of preeminent importance in weighing such requests.

15 4.	All overtime shall be at the option of the Chief of Police.

16 5.	Application of the provisions contained in this Article shall not involve pyramiding of

17 overtime.	During a period of time there are two (2) concurrent overtime rates, the

18 following procedure shall be used to determine the rate for that period:

19 a.	If both rates are at time and one-half (11/2X), the employee is paid at a rate of time

20 and one-half (11/2X).

21 b.	If one of the rates is time and one-half (11/2X) and the other straight-time (1X), the

22 employee is paid at a rate of time and one-half (11/2X).

23 c.	If both rates are straight-time (1X), the employee is paid at a straight-time (1X)

1 rate.

2 d.	For purposes of construction and interpretation of this provision, a court

3 appearance involving the three and three quarter hour court overtime minimum

4 payment shall be deemed a two and one-half-hour period of time and one-half

5 (1.5X) overtime beginning with the start of such court appearance.

6 6.	The hourly pay used in the computation of overtime shall be equal to one-eightieth (1/80)

7 of the employee's current biweekly base salary as provided for in the BASE SALARY

8 provision of this Agreement.

9 7.	Overtime shall be compensated for each actual hour or nearest 0.1 of an hour of

10 authorized overtime worked.

11 8.	Any payment made under the provisions of this Article shall not have any sum deducted

12 for pension benefits nor shall such payments be included in the determination of pension

13 benefits or other fringe benefits.

14 9.	The terms and conditions agreed to between the parties in respect to Police Band

15 overtime (except as stated below), court overtime parking and negative comp time

16 balances, which are set forth respectively in City/MPA Memoranda of Understanding

17 dated: September 14, 1983 (Police Band Overtime), October 12, 1983, and November

18 16, 1983 (Court Overtime Parking) and December  15, 1983 (Negative Comp Time

19 Balances) shall be incorporated into the provisions of this Article and be made a part of

20 this Agreement as Appendix B.	The terms and conditions of the Memorandum of

21	September 14, 1983 (Police Band Overtime) shall be amended to provide that the

22 Compensatory Time Off Bank (CTB) time is the same as provided in subsection 3.b.(1)

23 of this Article.

1 10.	Miscellaneous Overtime Provisions

2 a.	Roll Call

3 Existing roll-call time practices will be maintained for the term of this Agreement

4 or any agreed-upon extension thereof. Effective August 11, 1985, and for so long

5 as employees are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) during the

6 term of this Agreement, or any agreed upon extension thereof, the 18-minute roll-

7 call period shall be reduced to a 12-minute period with all overtime earned during

8 such 12-minute period compensated at time and one-half (11/2X) the base salary

9 rate. If and when employees are no longer covered by the FLSA, the roll-call

10 period shall be increased to an 18-minute period and overtime earned as a result

11 of roll-call shall be compensated at base salary rates (1X). Identification

12 Technicians who are assigned to perform street duties shall attend roll call and

13 receive roll call pay.

14 b.	Compensatory Time Off

15 If and when the City is required by law to pay cash for overtime work performed

16 that could otherwise have been paid for in compensatory time off under the

17 provisions of this Agreement, the City may modify overtime provisions to assure

18 that overtime compensation (whether in cash, compensatory time, or both) for all

19 overtime work performed shall not exceed 11/2X the employee's base rate of pay.



20 ARTICLE 16

21 FIRE AND POLICE COMMISSION OVERTIME
22 1.	Definition

1 Fire and Police Commission Overtime shall be defined as time spent by an employee
2 outside of his/her regularly scheduled eight-hour work shift, (as such eight-hour work shift
3 is defined under the HOURS OF WORK Article of this Agreement) under subpoena at a
4 trial proceeding conducted by the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners (FPC);
5 provided such FPC trial proceeding resulted from either a citizen complaint filed with the
6 FPC, or an appeal from discipline administered by the Chief of Police, and provided
7 further that the employee so subpoenaed was involved in the incident which gave rise to
8 the complaint or the discipline. The extent of involvement occasioning an employee's
9 appearance at a FPC trial proceeding, where such appearance was solely for the
10 dispositional phase of that proceeding, shall, in addition to covering involvement in the
11 incident which gave rise to the complaint or the discipline, cover any other involvement
12 such employee had in the course of his/her employment in the Police Department with the
13 defendant(s) in such complaint or discipline. The term, "FPC trial proceeding," as used
14 herein, shall also include FPC conciliation proceedings.
15 2.	Limitations
16 a.	Fire and Police Commission Overtime shall not include overtime assignments
17 made by the Chief of Police. Overtime assignments made by the Chief of Police
18 shall be covered by Article 15 of this Agreement entitled OVERTIME.
19 b.	An employee shall not be entitled to any compensation for an FPC trial proceeding
20 during the time period he/she is suspended from duty with pay.
21 c.	An employee   shall   be   required   to   turn   over   to   the   Police   Department
22 Administration all witness fees he/she received as a result of a FPC trial
23 proceeding for which the employee received Fire and Police Commission
24 Overtime pay, and make no subsequent claim for this money whatsoever.

12 It shall be the right of the City to select and, from time to time, to change the carrier(s),

24 ARTICLE 21

25 HEALTH INSURANCE
26 Certain items contained in this Article are currently under litigation.

1 1.	Benefits
2 a.	Basic Plan
3 During the term of this Agreement, Basic Plan health insurance benefits shall be
4 the same as the Basic Plan benefits that were provided in the 2007-2009
5 City/Association Agreement, including the following provisions:
6 (1)	Every medical procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis shall
7 not be covered by these benefits when the procedure is performed on a
8 hospital inpatient basis. Procedures that can be performed on an outpatient
9 basis that are done on an inpatient basis in conjunction with other
10 procedures requiring inpatient status, or any procedures performed on an
11 inpatient basis   that   constitute   a   medically   verifiable   exception   (as
12 determined by the Utilization Review Contractor) to the requirement that it
13 be performed on an outpatient basis, shall be covered.
14 (2)	A Utilization Review Case Management Program (UR/CM) program shall
15 be established by the City for all elective procedures. Elective procedures
16 subject to the UR/CM program shall include all treatments for mental
17 health disorders and substance abuse and home health care services. The
18 program would be an independent review that assures each patient that the
19 proposed hospitalization is necessary, based upon the medical condition of
20 the patient, delivered in the most appropriate medical setting (inpatient or
21 outpatient) and fair and equitably priced. Whenever an elective procedure
22 is recommended for an employee, or his/her dependents, by a physician, the
23 employee shall be required to notify the designated UR/CM program
24 representative of this fact by telephone at the time such procedure is
25 recommended, in accordance with procedures established by the Employee
26 Benefits Manager for that purpose. Any elective procedure not submitted
27 to the designated UR/CM program representative shall not be covered by

1 these benefits.	UR/CM shall  determine whether or not a procedure is
2 elective. Within 48 hours of the hospital admission time for any urgent or
3 emergency procedure performed on an employee, or his/her dependents, the
4 employee or adult responsible for him/her, shall be required to notify the
5 designated UR/CM program representative of this fact by telephone in
6 accordance with procedures established by the Employee Benefits Manager
7 for that purpose; provided however, that if bona fide medical circumstances
8 applicable to   the   employee   preclude   compliance   with   the   48-hour
9 notification requirement, UR/CM shall authorize reasonable extension of
10 this time   limit   consistent   with   such   medical   circumstances   or   the
11 availability of an adult responsible for the employee. Following its review
12 of an elective procedure contemplated for an employee, or his/her
13 dependents, UR/CM will inform the employee of its determination in
14 respect to approval or denial of the procedure. After the patient informs
15 his/her physician that the proposed elective procedure must be approved by
16 the UR/CM program representative and the physician has contacted such
17 representative, the UR/CM program will determine if the procedure will be
18 approved   or   denied.	If the   physician   and   the   UR/CM   program
19 representative disagree, discussions between them will continue in an
20 attempt to resolve the disagreement. If discussions over five working days
21 do not resolve the issue, the Employe Benefits Manager shall appoint a
22 local physician   who   practices   in   a   medical   field   relevant   to   the
23 contemplated elective procedure and who is not affiliated with the
24 employee's physician. The second physician's findings shall be submitted
25 to the UR/CM program representative for review. If the second physician's
26 prescribed treatment is approved by the UR/CM program representative, it
27 shall be the treatment which is covered. In the event that both physicians

1 either prescribe the same course of treatment, or each prescribes a different
2 one, and the procedure(s) does(do) not meet the standards of the UR/CM
3 program representative, and no compromise can be effected, the UR/CM
4 program representative will approve the course of treatment prescribed by
5 the   employee's   physician.	Once established,   the   foregoing   appeal
6 procedure shall remain in effect until the execution date of the successor
7 contract to this Agreement.
8 (3)	The major medical deductible shall be $100 per person, $300 per family
9 maximum on the Basic Plan.
10 (4)	Transplant Benefit
11 (a)	Medically necessary human to human heart transplants shall be a
12 covered benefit under the Basic Plan. The participant must obtain
13 prior authorization from the Utilization Review Contractor.	The
14 Utilization Review Contractor shall determine the medical necessity.
15 (b)	The aggregate lifetime maximum benefit limit per participant for all
16 organ or tissue transplant services for all covered transplant
17 procedures is $250,000. This aggregate lifetime maximum benefit
18 limit applies to all benefits arising out of an organ or tissue
19 transplant.
20 (5)	The maximum annual benefit per participant for outpatient services for
21 alcoholism, drug abuse and nervous and mental disorders provided in the
22 outpatient department of a hospital, an Outpatient Treatment Facility or a
23 physician's office, that is provided under the "Hospital Surgical-Medical
24 Group Master Plan Document for City of Milwaukee" shall be two
25 thousand dollars ($2,000).	The maximum benefits provided under the
26 "Major Medical Coverage" section of the Basic Plan for benefits for
27 professional services for psychiatric care, including any type of nervous or

1 mental care provided to a participant without confinement, shall be 80% of
2 two thousand ($2,000) of charges.
3 (6)	The Major Medical lifetime maximum benefit shall be 4		$500,000.
5 b.	Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans
6 (1)	Except as provided in subsection 1.b.(2), hereunder, employees shall have
7 the right to select coverage under an HMO Plan approved by the City in
8 lieu of coverage provided by the Basic Plan. The benefits of the HMO
9 plans will be substantially the same as the Basic Plan benefits.	The
10 benefits for employees enrolled in an HMO plan offered by the City shall
11 be the uniform benefits specified in the 1999-2000 City of Milwaukee's
12 Request for Proposals from Health Maintenance Organizations.
13 (2)	The City may offer to employees an Exclusive Provider Organization
14 (EPO) Plan instead of or in addition to a Health Maintenance Organization
15 (HMO) Plan. An EPO Plan offered by the City shall use a Southeastern
16 Wisconsin network and shall only include in-network benefits. There shall
17 be no coverage for services obtained outside of the EPO Plan network. The
18 benefits for employees enrolled in an EPO Plan offered by the City shall be
19 the uniform benefits specified in the 1999-2000 City of Milwaukee's
20 Request for Proposals from Health Maintenance Organizations. In the
21 event that the City offers an EPO Plan instead of or in addition to an HMO
22 Plan, any references to "Health Maintenance Organization" or "HMO" in
23 this Agreement shall be understood to also refer to an "Exclusive Provider
24 Organization", "EPO", or to a combination of Health Maintenance
25 Organizations and Exclusive Provider Organizations.
26 (3)	Effective	January	1,	2008,	the	following	co-payments	shall	be
27 implemented:


1(a)An employee shall pay a $10.00 office visit co-payment (OVCP) for2all office or urgent care visits due to illness or injury, except as noted3in 1.b.(3)(b) and (c), hereunder.4(b)The OVCP shall be waived for preventive exams, tests, and other5age-appropriate procedures as determined by the plan for screening,6pre-natal and baby wellness.7(c)The OVCP shall be waived for on-going disease management office8visits as determined by the plan.9(d)An employee shall pay a $50.00 emergency room co-payment for10each emergency room visit.11(e)The prescription drug card plan under the uniform benefits shall be12replaced with a three-tier drug card plan.

12 administer the Basic Plan and/or the Basic Dental Plan, then effective with the calendar
13 month during which this election becomes effective, and so long as it continues in effect, the
14 maximum City contributions provided in subsections 3 and 4, above, for employees covered
15 by such a self-administered plan shall be reduced by an amount equal to 100% of the
16 difference between the monthly administrative costs associated with such plan prior to the
17 effective date it became self-administered and the monthly administrative costs associated
18 with the plan when it is self-administered, capitated for each subscriber in the plans on the
19 basis of single or family enrollment status. While in effect, this provision shall not increase
20 an employee's payroll deductions required to meet the costs of his/her health/dental
21 insurance benefits beyond the deductions that would be required under subsections 3, 4 and
22 8 of this Article, if the provision was not in effect.
23 6.	Right of City to Select Carrier
24 It shall be the right of the City to select and, from time to time, to change any of its carriers
25 that provide the benefits set forth in subsection 1. of this Article; at its sole option, the City
26 shall have the right to provide any or all of these benefits on a self-insured basis and/or to
27 self-administer them (in this circumstance, the term "carrier" as used in this Article shall

1 also mean self-insurer and/or self-administrator).
2 7.	Non-duplication
3 a.	If more than one City employee is a member of the same family, as that term is
4 defined in provisions of the Plans defined in subsection 1. of this Article, the
5 coverage shall be limited to one family plan.
6 b.	In the event a program of health insurance is adopted by the Federal or State
7 government and the City is required or elects to participate, benefits under the City
8 plan shall be coordinated with such systems but shall not operate to increase or
9 diminish the extent of the coverage.
10 c.	A retiree shall be ineligible to receive the retiree health insurance benefits provided
11 hereunder when receiving health insurance benefits from other employment or from
12 the employment of the retiree's spouse if the benefits received by the spouse cover
13 the retiree.
14 d.	City health insurance cost contributions provided hereunder to retirees shall be in
15 lieu of any other City retiree health insurance contributions provided by ordinance,
16 resolution or by other means, while retirees are receiving the benefits hereunder.
17 e.	After the deductible is paid, the employee's share of the cost for claims made under
18 the Major Medical co-insurance provisions shall not be less than 20%.
19 f.	In the event an employee becomes eligible for Medicare benefits prior to attaining
20 age 65, the City will contribute an amount up to the City's maximum contribution
21 provided in subsection 3.c.(1), of this Article towards the cost of coverage for the
22 City's Medicare Supplemental Plan.
23 8.	Employees on Leave of Absence
24 Employees in active service may elect to be covered by the benefits in subsections 1.a. or
25 1.b. of this Article, above, while on an authorized leave of absence.	Individuals on an

2 authorized leave of absence.
3 9.	There shall be a 270-day waiting period for pre-existing conditions for the benefits provided

8 65, shall be entitled to:
9 (1)	The same health insurance benefits concurrently provided employees in active
10 service covered by the effective Agreement between the City and the
11 Association as is in effect from time to time (it is understood that the exclusion
12 of retirees from coverage under dental insurance benefits, as set forth above,
13 shall continue unchanged). If a retiree eligible for these benefits dies prior to
14 age 65, the retiree's surviving spouse shall be eligible for these benefits until
15 the last day of the month in which the deceased retiree would have attained age
16 65; and
17 (2)	The same City/retiree health insurance cost sharing formula that was provided
18 for such retiree by this Agreement.
19 This paragraph shall only cover the kinds of retirements for which health
20 insurance coverage is provided by this Agreement.
21 11. Effective Date
22 Except where specifically provided otherwise herein, the provisions of this Article shall be
23 deemed to be in force and effect beginning January 1, 2010, and ending December 31, 2012.

27 If any portion of the Global Pension Settlement Agreement or implementing Charter

1 Ordinance is held invalid, or if compliance with it is restrained by operation of law or by any
2 court of competent jurisdiction, the parties shall immediately enter into collective bargaining
3 for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such portion of the
4 Global Pension Settlement Agreement or Charter Ordinance.
5 This paragraph shall in no way affect or restrict other benefits unrelated to retiree health
6 insurance benefits in the Global Settlement Agreement.


7 ARTICLE 22

8 SICK LEAVE
9 1.	Definition: "Sick Leave" shall mean all necessary absence from duty because of illness,
10 bodily injury, or exclusion from employment because of exposure to contagious disease.
11 2.	Eligibility for sick leave with pay for employees newly appointed to City employment shall
12 begin after completion of six months active service in the Police Department, but sick leave
13 credit shall be earned from date of appointment.
14 3.	Employees shall earn sick leave with pay at the rate of one and one-quarter (11/4) working
15 days for each month of active service or 4.6 working hours for each two weeks of active
16 service.	Sick leave with pay earned by employees shall be credited to their sick leave
17 account.	Employees may utilize sick leave with pay credited to their accounts during
18 periods of sick leave for the period of time they would have worked in accordance with the
19 regularly scheduled hours of work as established under the HOURS OF WORK provision of
20 this Agreement.
21 4.	Regardless of the sick leave credit earned the maximum amount of sick leave with pay
22 which employees may utilize from their accounts for any one period of continuous sick
23 leave shall not exceed 365 calendar days. Interruption of such period of sick leave shall
24 only be considered if the employee resumes his/her regular duty.
25 5.	Whenever an employee requests sick leave with pay he or she shall immediately notify his
26 or her commanding officer of this fact.	Such notification may be by telephone.	Each

1 instance of sick leave that the employee fails to comply with the requirements of this
2 subsection shall result in the employee losing his/her entitlement to any sick leave with pay
3 for that instance.
4 6.	Except as otherwise provided herein, sick leave may be permitted without requiring the
5 employee to submit medical substantiation from a private physician, provided that the
6 employee completes Form PS-16 (Application for Sick Leave), and submits same to his or
7 her commanding officer. An employee may be required by his or her commanding officer
8 to provide acceptable medical substantiation from a private physician or dentist for each
9 absence, regardless of duration, if the commanding officer is informed or believes that the
10 employee is misusing sick leave. The City shall not be responsible for the payment of any
11 fee charged by the physician or dentist to provide the acceptable medical substantiation.
12 7.	When medical substantiation from an employee's private physician is required, the failure of
13 the employee to comply with this requirement shall permit the City to deny that employee
14 the sick leave benefits provided hereunder until he/she is in compliance with such
15 requirement.
16 8.	The sick leave account for an employee returning to active service from duty disability
17 retirement shall be the employee's unused sick leave credit or 30 working days of sick leave,
18 whichever is greater.
19 9.	Employees reporting absent on sick leave shall be governed by the rules and regulations and
20 standard operating procedures of the Police Department pertaining thereto in effect on the
21 execution date of this Agreement.
22 10. Attendance Incentive Program
23 a.	The Sick Leave Control Incentive Program shall be in effect beginning Trimester 1,
24 2010, and ending, at the end of Trimester 3, 2012. Nothing herein shall be construed
25 as requiring the City to continue the program for time periods after Trimester 3, 26	2012.
27	b.	The trimester periods for each calendar year are defined as follows:


1Trimester 1 - Pay Period 1-92Trimester 2 - Pay Period 10-183Trimester 3 - Pay Period 19-26 or Pay Period 19-27, whichever is4appropriate.5c.An employee shall be eligible for a trimester sick leave incentive benefit only if:6(1)	During the full term of the trimester, the employee did not use any paid sick7leave, did not receive injury pay for the full term of that trimester, was not on8an unpaid leave of absence, was not AWOL, was not tardy, was not suspended9from duty for disciplinary reasons and did not take any unpaid time off the10payroll; and11(2)	During the full term of the trimester, the employee was in active service; and12(3)	At the beginning of the trimester, the employee had an amount of earned and13unused sick leave credit in his/her sick leave account of 20 days; and
14 (4)	The employee was represented by the MPA at the end of the trimester period.
15 d.	In a Trimester period set forth in subsection a. and b., above, that an employee is
16 eligible for an attendance incentive program benefit, the commanding officer shall
17 determine which one of the two types of attendance incentive benefits listed below
18 the eligible employee shall receive (at the commanding officer's discretion, the
19 employee may make this determination in accordance with procedures established
20 for that purpose by the Department):
21 (1)	A special attendance incentive payment
22 An employee receiving a special sick leave incentive payment, shall be entitled
23 to receive a lump-sum cash payment equivalent to eight hours of his/her base
24 salary computed on the basis of his/her hourly base salary rate in effect on the
25 last day of the trimester for which the payment was earned. Such payment
26 shall not be deemed part of the employee's base salary and shall not have any
27 sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall it be included in determination of

1 pension benefits or any other benefits and/or compensation provided by the
2 City.	Attendance incentive payments provided hereunder shall be made as
3 soon as is administratively practicable following the close of the Trimester
4 Period in which they were earned.
5 (2)	A special incentive leave
6 An employee receiving a special incentive leave, shall earn one eight-hour day
7 off with pay. Such day off with pay must be used by the employee in the next
8 succeeding trimester. An employee may use such day off with pay on a date
9 he/she has requested provided the employee gives his/her commanding officer
10 reasonable advance notice of the date requested and the date is determined
11 available by the commanding officer in accordance with  the needs  of the
12 Department. The processing of employee requests for time off earned under
13 the attendance incentive control program shall be on a first-come, first-served
14 basis. Decisions by the employee's commanding officer with respect to the
15 availability of the date the employee has requested shall be final.

26 and

1 c.	Not to exceed three (3) days with pay in case of death of the employee's step-mother,
2 step-father or step-children by virtue of the employee's current spouse; during the
3 employee's lifetime, eligibility to use step-parent funeral leave benefits shall be
4 limited to one (1) step-father and one (1) step-mother, regardless of the number of
5 step-parents.
6 An employee eligible for the leave with pay provided hereunder may only use that leave
7 during the seven (7) consecutive calendar day time period immediately following the date of
8 the death that occasioned the employee's request for the leave.
9 3.	In the event of the death of any other relative, employees shall be permitted to change their
10 next regular day off so they may attend the funeral.
11 4.	At his/her option, an employee who is granted funeral leave during a scheduled vacation
12 period may elect to either extend his/her vacation period by the number of funeral leave days
13 granted or have the vacation days that were changed to funeral leave days rescheduled at a
14 later date as a segmented vacation.	The employee shall notify the Police Department
15 Administration of his/her decision with respect to such election prior to the end of the
16 vacation period in which the Funeral Leave was granted.

25 governed by the Rules and Regulations of the Police Department.

1 ARTICLE 25

2 INJURY PAY
3 1.	When employees, covered by this Agreement, sustain injuries within the scope of their
4 employment for which they are entitled to receive worker's compensation temporary
5 disability benefits, as provided by Chapter 102 of the Wisconsin Statutes (Worker's
6 Compensation Act), they may receive 80% of their base salary as "injury pay" instead of
7 such worker's compensation benefits for the period of time they may be temporarily totally
8 or temporarily partially disabled because of such injuries.	Such injury pay shall not be
9 granted for more than 365 calendar days for any one compensable injury or recurrence
10 thereof.	A compensable injury associated with or arising from one or more separate
11 incidents occurring prior to the incident constituting its immediate cause shall be deemed a
12 recurrence and shall not give rise to additional injury pay entitlement. The 80% provision
13 shall become effective January 1, 1985, and shall cover employees receiving injury pay
14 benefits on or after that date regardless of the date on which the compensable injury, or
15 recurrence thereof, occurred.
16 2.	In providing injury pay in an amount equal to 80% of the employee's base salary, the
17 employee agrees to allow the City to make a payroll adjustment to his/her biweekly
18 paycheck deducting an amount equal to 20% of his/her base salary for that portion of the
19 pay period he/she received injury pay and make no subsequent claim for said amount
20 whatsoever.   Such deduction shall be administered so as not to reduce employee pension
21 benefits. For purposes of interpretation of the provisions of this Article, the term base salary
22 as used herein shall mean the employee's base salary pay rate in effect during the pay period
23 he/she is claiming injury pay as that base salary rate is established in the BASE SALARY
24 Article of this Agreement.
25 3.	After "injury pay" benefits have been exhausted, employees shall have the option of
26 accepting sick leave benefits or accepting worker's compensation temporary disability
27 benefits. This option, which shall be in writing, may be terminated without prejudice to

1 temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits under the Worker's Compensation
2 Act thereafter, but such termination shall not be retroactive and any sick leave already used
3 at the time of such termination of option shall not be restored to the employee.
4 4.	Questions involving eligibility for injury pay shall be determined under the applicable law
5 and the substantive and procedural rules of the Department of Workforce Development
6 relative to Worker's Compensation and in the event of a dispute between the City and the
7 employee relative to such eligibility, the Department of Workforce Development and the
8 courts upon the statutorily prescribed review thereof shall be the sole and final arbiters of
9 such dispute.
10 5.	In all third-party claims or actions, the City shall not be limited in its recovery to the amount
11 of temporary disability benefits which would otherwise have been payable under the
12 Worker's Compensation Act, but shall instead be entitled to recover the amount of injury pay
13 received by the employee. In the event the City recovers an amount of injury pay received
14 by the employee, the City shall restore the employee's number of calendar days (equivalent
15 amount of recovery) for said injury.
16 6.	Whenever an employee sustains a compensable injury, he or she shall immediately notify
17 his or her commanding officer of this fact. Each instance of injury pay that the employee
18 fails to comply with the requirement of this subsection shall result in the employee losing
19 his/her entitlement to any injury pay for that instance.
20 7.	Employees reporting absent due to a compensable injury shall be governed by the Rules and
21 Regulations and Standard Operating Procedure of the Police Department pertaining thereto.
22 8.	If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines that the injury pay benefits provided
23 hereunder are taxable as wages, then beginning with the effective date of such
24 determination, the City will no longer require the 20% employee deduction from injury pay
25 benefits provided for in subsections 1. and 2. of this Article, above.
26 9.	In no case shall temporary disability benefits and injury pay be allowed for the same period
27 of time.

1 10. Employees appointed to the Police Officer position classification shall not be entitled to the
2 injury pay benefits provided hereunder for any injury they may sustain while on duty prior
3 to the start of field training during the period of time they are assigned to the Police Training
4 Academy for recruit training.	Such employees shall instead be covered by State of
5 Wisconsin Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) temporary disability benefits during such
6 period, including all applicable terms and conditions provided for in the WCA.	The
7 provisions of subsections 6, 7 and 9, above, shall be applicable to employees governed by
8 this subsection.
9 11. During the period of an employee's absence from duty due to a duty-incurred injury, the
10 employee shall be permitted to leave his/her residence or place of confinement so long as
11 he/she has first obtained a written statement from his/her personal physician stating that such
12 travel will further his/her recuperation and the employee has first presented his/her personal
13 physician's statement to his/her commanding officer or shift commander.	Whenever an
14 employee authorized to leave his/her residence or place of confinement, leaves the confines
15 of Milwaukee County, he/she shall provide his/her commanding officer written advance
16 notice of this departure indicating on the notice the time period he/she will be out of
17 Milwaukee County, location(s) where he/she can be reached and, if a location has an address
18 and/or telephone number, the address and/or telephone number of the location(s). While
19 outside the confines of Milwaukee County, the employee shall be required to notify his/her
20 commanding officer of his/her whereabouts by telephone of any changes in the locations
21 indicated on the advance notice. During any fifteen (15) day period, an employee shall not
22 be permitted to remain outside the confines of Milwaukee County for more than 14
23 consecutive calendar days.	Except as provided herein and in subsection 6 of the
24 VACATION Article of this Agreement, Rule 5, Section 7 of the Milwaukee Police
25 Department Rules and Regulations shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
26	*	*	*
27	The fact that the parties have entered into an agreement preserving the status of Article 25

1 shall not be used by either party as evidence or argument in pending proceedings to revoke
2 the City of Milwaukee's self-insured status.	In the event of a final determination by a
3 competent tribunal, both parties shall abide by the decision and negotiate any modifications
4 either party feels are necessary in the successor agreement


5 ARTICLE 26

6 TERMINAL LEAVE
7 1.	An employee retiring on City pension under either the Employees' Retirement System of
8 Milwaukee plan or the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund plan (but excluding retirement
9 on deferred pension when employee has less than 25 years' service or actuarially reduced
10 pension, as they are defined in both plans) shall, upon retirement, be entitled to receive a
11 lump sum payment equivalent to one eight-hour workday's base salary for each one eight-
12 hour day of the employee's earned and unused sick leave up to a maximum of fifty-five (55)
13 such equivalent eight-hour workdays of base salary. The term "eight-hour workday's base
14 salary," as used herein, is defined as an amount equivalent to the employee's biweekly base
15 salary, as defined and determined by the BASE SALARY Article of this Agreement, divided 16	by 10.
17 2.	When a terminal leave payment is paid to a deferred retiree with 25 or more years' service,
18 the payment will be made on the deferred retiree's effective date of separation based on
19 his/her pay rate and sick leave accumulation in effect at that time.
20 3.	An employee shall be eligible to receive the terminal leave pay benefit only once during
21 his/her lifetime.
22 4.	Terminal leave payments shall not be construed as being part of employee's base salary and
23 shall not be included in the computation of any fringe benefits enumerated in this
24 Agreement.
25 5.	Terminal leave payments shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall
26 such payments be included in any computation establishing pension benefits or payments.

5 a.	Rates For Calendar Years 2010, 2011 and 2012
6 (1)	Eight (8) hours for each calendar month of active service since an employee's
7 last anniversary date up to a maximum of eighty (80) hours per calendar year
8 for an employee with less than seven (7) years of active service.
9 (2)	Twelve (12) hours for each calendar month of active service since an
10 employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of one hundred twenty
11 (120) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least seven (7) years but
12 less than twelve (12) years of active service.
13 (3)	Sixteen (16) hours for each calendar month of active service since the
14 employee's last anniversary date, up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160)
15 hours per calendar year for an employee with at least twelve (12) years but less
16 than twenty (20) years of active service .
17 (4)	Twenty (20) hours for each calendar month of active service since an
18 employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of two hundred (200) hours
19 per calendar year for an employee with at least twenty (20) years of active
20 service.
21 b.	For purposes of pro-rating, an employee in active service for at least fourteen (14)
22 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as having been in active service for the full
23 calendar month; in the event the employee is in active service for less than 14 days in
24 a calendar month, then the employee shall be deemed as not being in active service
25 at all during the calendar month.
26 c.	The time period during which an employee earns vacation with pay for a calendar
27 year shall be limited to the employee's period of active service between his/her

1 anniversary date for that calendar year and his/her immediate preceding anniversary
2 date.	The amount of vacation time taken during a calendar year, except for
3 separation from service as provided in subsection 5 below, shall be limited to the
4 maximums noted in this subsection, above. These maximums are not guarantees; an
5 employee is not entitled to any greater vacation with pay in a calendar year than that
6 which he/she has earned for that calendar year.
7 4.	Employees must use vacation time during the calendar year for which such vacation time is
8 earned; employees who do not use all of their entitled vacation time within the calendar year
9 for which it was earned shall lose all rights to the unused time off.
10 5.	Vacation time taken before the full amount has been earned shall be considered time owed
11 the City until it is earned.	Any employee who leaves the service of the City due to
12 resignation, retirement, termination, discharge, layoff or death will have the compensation
13 for vacation time owed the City deducted from the final paycheck.	In the event the
14 employee's last pay check is for an amount less than the amount of compensation owed the
15 City, a deduction shall also be made from the employee's next preceding pay check that
16 covers the balance of compensation owed the City. Any employee who leaves the service of
17 the City due to resignation, retirement, layoff or death or who takes military leave will be
18 paid for earned vacation time that has accumulated. If an employee returns to duty prior to
19 his/her next following anniversary date, any vacation time earned and taken hereunder shall
20 be offset against the employee's earned vacation time for the calendar year in which that
21 anniversary date falls.	Discharge employees are not entitled to pay for accumulated
22 vacation time.
23 6.	An employee on authorized injury leave as a result of a duty-incurred injury may use
24 vacation scheduled during the period of such leave provided the Police Department
25 Administration receives a written advance request to use the vacation, which indicates the
26 time and place of the vacation, and provided further, the employee's private physician has
27 authorized use of this vacation. Injured employees not using vacation scheduled during the

1 period of their leave shall have their unused vacation rescheduled by the Police Department
2 Administration when they return to duty, if it is possible to do so, before the end of the
3 calendar year. In the event the Police Department Administration is unable to reschedule all
4 of the  employee's remaining unused  vacation before the  end of the calendar year,  the
5 employee shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equivalent to the dollar value of
6 the remaining unused vacation at the end of the calendar year, computed on the basis of the
7 employee's base salary rate in effect at the time for which the vacation was originally
8 scheduled. This lump sum payment shall be made as soon as is administratively practicable
9 following the end of the calendar year. The lump sum payment shall not be construed as
10 being part of the employee's base salary and shall not be included in the computation of any
11 fringe benefits enumerated in this Agreement. The lump sum payment shall not have any
12 sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall it be included in any computation establishing
13 pension benefits or payments. When authorized by the Police Department Administration,
14 an employee may elect to carry over into the next succeeding calendar year any remaining
15 unused vacation that the Police Department Administration was unable to reschedule by the
16 end of the calendar year, instead of the lump sum payment provided above. The vacation
17 carried over shall be used by March 1 of the following calendar year or the employee will
18 lose all rights to it, including all rights to the lump sum payment provided above.	The
19 scheduling of carried-over vacation shall be subject to availability of the dates requested by
20 the employee, require prior approval by the employee's Commanding Officer and in no way
21 affect the scheduling of other employees' vacations.
22 7.	Employees on authorized sick leave shall have their vacation that was scheduled during such
23 leave rescheduled by the Police Department Administration when they return to duty if it is
24 possible to do so before the end of the calendar year. In the event the Police Department
25 Administration is unable to reschedule all of the employee's remaining unused vacation
26 before the end of the calendar year, the City, upon the employee's return to duty, will restore
27 to the employee's sick leave account an amount of time equal to the amount of unused

1 vacation.
2 8.	Employees in active service shall have time spent receiving a duty disability retirement
3 allowance included as years of service for purposes of computing current and prospective
4 vacation benefits.
5 9.	Segmented Vacation Periods
6 a.	An employee may segment up to all of the portion of his/her maximum annual
7 vacation time entitlement earned under paragraph 3 that exceeds eighty (80) hours
8 into units of one (1), two (2), three (3) or four (4) consecutive eight-hour work days.
9 The aggregate amount of an employee's segmented vacation for a calendar year shall
10 be deemed a segmented vacation period. All other vacation benefits to which an
11 employee is entitled shall be taken in five (5) consecutive eight-hour workday units
12 in accordance with existing Departmental practices.
13 b.	A segmented vacation period may be used during the time period from January 1
14 through and including December 31 of a calendar year.
15 c.	An employee requesting a segmented vacation period in a calendar year shall, prior
16 to March 15 of such calendar year, notify his/her commanding officer in writing of
17 this fact on a form provided by the City, setting forth thereon the number of
18 segmented days requested.	Notification requirements as to the specific dates
19 requested by the employee for his/her segmented vacation shall be as set forth in
20 subsection 9.d., below. An employee failing to comply with this requirement shall
21 not be permitted a segmented vacation period during such calendar year. The Police
22 Department Administration shall have the authority to limit the aggregate number of
23 segmented vacation days requested in the time period provided for in subsection b.,
24 above, if it determines that granting additional requests for segmented vacation
25 periods will result in insufficient manpower being available to meet the needs of the
26 Police Service.
27 d.	For each   unit   of   segmented   vacation,   the   employee   shall   provide   his/her

1 commanding officer with reasonable advance notice indicating the date(s) on which
2 the employee wants to use such unit of segmented vacation; such advance notice
3 shall be provided in writing no later than 72 hours prior to the first day of the
4 segmented unit of vacation.	Except for requested segmented vacation dates
5 occurring on or before March 15 of the calendar year, no requested dates for
6 segmented vacation will be processed by the Department until all non-segmented
7 vacations for that calendar year have been selected by every employee in the
8 Association bargaining unit. All segmented days must be scheduled or requested on
9 or before October 15th of the calendar year; provided, however, that subject to the
10 approval of an employee's commanding officer, the October 15 deadline may be
11 waived because of emergency, or other extraordinary circumstance, affecting the
12 employee. An employee failing to comply with requirements of this subsection shall
13 have his/her unused segmented vacation time scheduled for him/her by his/her
14 commanding officer.
15 e.	All requests made by employees for scheduling units of segmented vacation that are
16 submitted in accordance with the time limit and notice requirements provided above
17 shall be processed on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the availability of the
18 dates requested determined by the employee's commanding officer. No request will
19 be granted that results in another employee losing any non-segmented vacation dates
20 he/she had previously selected in accordance with Departmental practices established
21 for that purpose.	In the event an employee's request for scheduling a unit of
22 segmented vacation is in compliance with all of the time limit and advance notice
23 requirements   provided	above, but   the   employee's   commanding   officer   has
24 determined that some or all of the dates requested by the employee for that unit are
25 unavailable, it shall be the responsibility of the employee to schedule available
26 substitute dates with his/her commanding officer.
27 10. The vacation with pay benefits computed under the provisions of this Article shall be the full

1 and only vacation benefits to which employees covered by this Agreement shall be entitled
2 during calendar years 2010, 2011 and 2012.
3 11. The assignment and scheduling of vacations with pay shall be controlled by the Chief of
4 Police. However, in exercising those controls, supervisors charged with the responsibility of
5 scheduling vacations shall not be prohibited from tentatively agreeing to allow members to
6 rearrange their scheduled off days in order to change the starting date of a non-segmented
7 vacation, if projected staffing needs would appear to permit such a rearrangement. If it is
8 necessary to revoke the tentative approval granted due to staffing needs, the member shall be
9 given notice no  later than seven days prior to the  first day the member is tentatively
10 scheduled to be absent.


11 ARTICLE 29

12 TIME OFF FOR JURY DUTY
13 1.	Employees covered by this Agreement shall be granted time off with pay for jury duty when
14 they are legally summoned for jury duty, subject to the terms and conditions provided for in
15 subsections 2 through 6, inclusive, of this Article, below.
16 2.	When an employee is legally summoned to report for jury duty he/she shall:
17 a)	Immediately notify his/her commanding officer and promptly submit to him/her a
18 written report, in "matter of" form, showing the date he/she is required to report for
19 such jury duty; and
20 b)	Complete City of Milwaukee form C-139 (Application for Jury Duty Pay) and
21 County of Milwaukee form 2448R16 (Official Jury Notice), and forward both
22 documents to the Police Department Administration Bureau-Payroll Section; and
23 c)	Submit a Certification of Jury Service form to the Police Department Administration
24 Bureau--Payroll Section at the end of his/her jury duty. Copies of this form may be
25 obtained from the Circuit Court Calendar Clerk.
26 3.	While on authorized jury duty employees shall be considered by the Police Department to be

1 working the day shift and shall be permitted to change their off-duty days (regular off and
2 vacation days) subject to approval from the Police Department Administration.	If  the
3 employee's off-duty days are changed, the employee shall be required to turn over all jury
4 duty payments he/she receives (excluding official travel pay) to the City; in the event the
5 employee's off-duty days are not changed he/she shall be entitled to retain the jury duty
6 payments he/she receives for jury duty performed on his/her off-duty days, but shall be
7 required to turn over to the City all other jury duty payments he/she receives (excluding
8 official travel pay).
9 4.	Employees shall not be eligible for overtime while on jury duty, even if such duty extends
10 beyond eight hours in one day; nor shall they be eligible for overtime for work performed
11 outside their regularly scheduled work shift that is the result of changes made pursuant to
12 subsection 3. of this Article, above.
13 5.	On days when the employee is normally scheduled to work, no greater amount of time off
14 for jury duty shall be granted than is necessary. If an employee is called for jury duty on
15 such day and reports thereto without receiving a jury assignment for that day, or if he/she is
16 engaged in jury duty for part of such day, he/she shall immediately notify his/her
17 commanding officer of this fact by telephone and report back to work for the remainder of
18 his/her work day. If the employee is engaged in jury duty for part of a day that falls on a
19 work day, then such requirement to report back to work shall not be applicable on days
20 where the amount of time remaining in the employee's regularly scheduled eight-hour shift
21 for that  day, together with travel time from the jury duty site to the employee's duty
22 assignment location, does not allow for a work period of reasonable length; in this
23 circumstance, the employee shall still be required to notify his/her commanding officer in
24 accordance with the requirement set forth above.	The criteria used in determining what
25 constitutes reasonable length shall be based on present Police Department practices covering
26 jury duty; notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee released from jury duty prior to 12:00
27 noon on a work day must report back to work for the remainder of his/her work day.

4 ARTICLE 31

5 TIME OFF IN LIEU OF HOLIDAYS
6 1.	Employees shall be entitled to receive up to ninety-six (96) hours off with pay in lieu of
7 holidays per fiscal year, one eight-hour period of which shall be designated by the Chief of
8 Police to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday.
9 2.	Employees in active service less than a fiscal year shall be entitled to time off in lieu of
10 holidays with pay prorated on the basis of their length of service during the fiscal year.
11 Time off in lieu of holidays shall be earned at a rate of eight (8) hours per calendar month
12 for each calendar month in a calendar year that the employee was on the Police Department
13 payroll.	For purposes of interpretation of this provision, an employee on the Police
14 Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as having been
15 on the Police Department payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is
16 on the Police Department payroll for less than 14 days in a calendar month, then the
17 employee shall be deemed as not having been on the payroll at all during such calendar
18 month.
19 3.	Except as provided in subsection 4 of this Article, below, such time off with pay shall be
20 used by the employee in the fiscal year in which they are earned; employees who do not use
21 all of their entitled time off in lieu of holidays within the fiscal year in which it was earned
22 shall lose all right to the unused time off.
23 4.	If an employee is unable to use all of the time off in lieu of holidays with pay to which the
24 employee is entitled during a fiscal year because of an extended period of authorized sick
25 leave that does not allow the Chief of Police to reschedule some or all of the employee's

1 unused time off in lieu of holidays in that fiscal year, then the City, upon the employee's
2 return to duty in the next fiscal year, will restore to the employee's sick leave account an
3 amount of time equal to the amount of such unused time off in lieu of holidays with pay that
4 the Chief of Police was unable to reschedule. This provision shall only cover time off in
5 lieu of holidays that is not integrated into the employee's regular work schedule. (In the case
6 of an employee assigned to a District Station on an eight-hour shift basis whose regular
7 work schedule is five days on-duty, two days off-duty, followed by four days on-duty, two
8 days off-duty, etc., this provision would cover the 32 hours off in lieu of holidays per fiscal
9 year that are not integrated into the employee's regular work schedule and would not cover
10 any of the 64 hours off in lieu of holidays per fiscal  year that are integrated into the
11 employee's regular work schedule.)
12 5.	The scheduling of work days off in lieu of holidays with pay shall be controlled by the Chief
13 of Police.


14 ARTICLE 32

15 HOLIDAY PREMIUM PAY
16 1.	Except as provided in paragraph 2, employees who are assigned to duty on July 4, December

18 compensated in cash at a rate of one and one-half (11/2) their base salary for all such assigned
19 duty worked from 12:00 a.m. through 11:59 p.m., inclusive, during such days.
20 2.	An employee may elect to receive such holiday compensation in compensatory time off in
21 lieu of cash, subject to the following terms and conditions:
22 a.	The employee's compensatory time off balance (CTB) recorded on the most current
23 Police Department Personnel Status Report must be less than 225 hours;
24 b.	Compensatory time off earned by an employee on a holiday listed above shall be
25 included in his/her CTB;
26 c.	The procedures governing the use of compensatory time off earned on holidays shall

1 be the same as those provided in the OVERTIME Article of this Agreement for use
2 of compensatory time off; and
3 d.	An employee may elect to receive compensatory time off in lieu of cash for work
4 performed during roll-call time on a holiday listed above, only if he/she
5 electecompensatory time off for all roll-call time worked during the Pay Period in
6 which the holiday occurred (this is consistent with existing Departmental procedures
7 governing eligibility for election of compensatory time off for roll-call time
8 overtime).
9 3.	For administrative purposes, all time so worked shall be computed to the nearest 0.1 of an
10 hour.	For purposes of interpretation and construction of this Article, the compensation
11 herein provided shall only be granted for authorized duty occurring on the actual calendar
12 dates that the four (4) holidays listed above fall; no such compensation will be granted for
13 duty on any other calendar date on which these four (4) holidays may officially be
14 celebrated or observed pursuant to law.
15 4.	Application of the provisions enumerated herein shall not involve pyramiding of the
16 compensation described herein. No employee shall receive overtime benefits and/or shift or
17 weekend differential benefits in addition to holiday premium pay.
18 5.	Any payment made in addition to the employee's base salary under the provisions of this
19 Article shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall such payments be
20 included in determining pension benefits or other fringe benefits.


21 ARTICLE 33

2 the property of the City and shall revert to the Police Department upon the
3 employee's severance from service from and after January 1, 1991.
4 (2)	Effective as soon after September 14, 1987, as administratively practicable,
5 one silver badge patch for the windbreaker shall be included in the initial issue.

14 equipment prescribed by the Chief of Police and, in addition, up to two
15 shirts or one uniform outer carrier and one turtleneck shirt or any
16 combination thereof totaling two items per year, whenever such articles
17 have been condemned on account of normal wear and tear. At his/her
18 option the employee may have either a summer short sleeve shirt or a
19 winter long sleeve shirt or a turtleneck shirt replaced.	The Chief of
20 Police shall issue a requisition to a vendor selected by the Standards and
21 Procurement Division for each replacement article required. Whenever
22 an article has been replaced through requisition, the employee shall be
23 required to present the requisitioned article to the Police Academy for
24 approval and the employee shall be required to turn in the condemned
25 article at the Police Academy. (Note: The intent of this Article shall be
26 as provided in a clarifying Negotiating Note between the City and the
27 Association dated October 7, 1977).

2 allowance of $300 per annum.
3 (c)	Payments made under subsection 1.b.(1)(b) of this Article shall be paid
4 in December of the year in which they were earned. Pro-rata adjustment
5 to the nearest calendar month on the basis of length of service shall be
6 made for employees occupying applicable classifications for less than a
7 full calendar year. For purposes of prorating, an employee on the payroll
8 and occupying such classifications for at least 14 days in a calendar
9 month shall  be deemed as  occupying such classification for the full
10 calendar month; in event the employee occupies the classification for
11 fewer than 14 days in a calendar month, the employee shall be deemed as
12 not occupying the classification at all during that calendar month.
13 (2)	Detectives, Chief Document Examiner, Police Audio Visual Specialist, Latent
14 Print Examiner, Identification Systems Specialist, Document Examiner and,
15 Identification Technician

25 classifications of Detective, Chief Document Examiner, Police Audio
26 Visual	Specialist,	Latent	Print	Examiner,	Identification	Systems
27 Specialist and Document Examiner and	Identification Technician, for

1 less than a full calendar year. For purposes of prorating, an employee on
2 the payroll   and   occupying the   classification   of   Detective,   Chief

23 member while such member is on duty. The provisions of item (2) of this paragraph shall
24 only be applicable to claims made in relation to incidents of theft where there is no
25 negligence on the part of the member.	The Chief of Police shall assess the amount of
26 damage, and he or she shall assess the amount of loss resulting from incidents of theft
27 compensable hereunder. For purposes of interpretation and construction, the term "items of

1 uniform and equipment prescribed by the Police Department" as used herein shall only
2 cover those items that were compensable under the terms of the UNIFORM AND
3 EQUIPMENT Article of the 2007-2009 City/MPA Agreement. Additionally, the Chief may,
4 at his or her discretion, approve other items of Uniform and Equipment as compensable
5 hereunder and shall assess the amount of damage or loss for such items.
6 4.	The following provisions shall apply to soft body armor which is a part of the Department's
7 initial issue for appointments occurring on or after the May 18, 1989, or a replacement under
8 paragraphs 1.b.(1)(a) or 3. of this Article occurring on or after May 18, 1989:
9 a.	As part of initial issue or replacement allowance that is provided under the
10 provisions of this Article, the Department will provide an employee with standard
11 issue soft body armor, the specifications of which shall be determined and prescribed
12 by the Chief of Police. The threat level for standard issue soft body armor prescribed
13 by the Chief shall not be less than threat level II (as this threat level standard is
14 defined and determined as of May 18, 1989), or its equivalent.
15 b.	In lieu of the standard issue, an employee may elect soft body armor with a threat
16 level IIIA classification; such election shall be in writing in a manner prescribed by
17 the Department. The threat level IIIA soft body armor elected shall be provided by
18 the Department and shall conform to specifications prescribed by the Chief of Police.
19 c.	Employees in active service appointed prior to May 18, 1989, who did not have the
20 option to elect soft body armor with a threat level higher than threat level II shall
21 have a one-time-only opportunity to elect threat level IIIA soft body armor
22 (employees making this election shall be required to turn in the soft body armor they
23 were issued at the time of their appointment). Such election shall be in writing in a
24 manner prescribed by the Department. Employees eligible to make an election must
25 do so before June 30, 1989.
26 d.	The Department shall meet the cost of soft body armor provided hereunder.
27 5.	Payments made under the provisions of this Article shall not be construed as being part of

1 the employee's base salary and shall not be included in the computation of any fringe
2 benefits enumerated in this Agreement. Any payment made under the provisions of this
3 Article shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall such payments be
4 included in any computation establishing pension benefits or payments.
5 6.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, during a calendar month employees
6 shall not be entitled to receive benefits under both subsections 1.b.(1) and 1.b.(2); instead
7 eligibility for receipt of benefits under either of these two subsections shall be predicated on
8 the length of service therein, the subsection with greater service determining the benefit (in
9 the event the length of service is identical the employee shall  be entitled to elect the
10 subsection under which his/her benefits shall be determined).
11 7.	At the discretion of the Chief of Police, an employee may not be granted benefits provided
12 by this Article where circumstances render the situation inappropriate.

14 NOTE:	As provided for the City/MPA Memorandum of Understanding relative to soft body
15 armor executed May 19, 1989, implementation of paragraph 4 of this Article is
16 contingent upon City Attorney approval requirements therein.

8 PARKING ALLOWANCE BENEFITS FOR POLICE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING
9 EMPLOYEES
10 1.	An employee with a regular Departmental assignment that requires him/her to work at or
11 report to a Police Administration Building (PAB) work location at the start of his/her regular
12 work shift as of the 15th day of a calendar month shall be eligible for a Regular Parking
13 Allowance benefit for that calendar month; such an employee shall be termed an "eligible
14 employee." The City shall reimburse an eligible employee the basic/general parking rate in
15 affect at the time of reimbursement.2.	The City shall provide
16 the Association with a list of City-approved parking facilities and will notify the Association
17 of any change that the City may from time to time make in this list at least sixty (60)
18 calendar days prior to the effective date of such change. Eligible employees shall be entitled
19 to receive either a Regular Parking Allowance benefit under the terms and conditions
20 hereinafter provided:
21 a.	Regular Parking Allowance Benefit
22 In order to receive a Regular Parking Allowance benefit for a calendar month, an
23 eligible employee must purchase a monthly parking permit for that month from a
24 parking facility on the City-approved list, endorse the permit (or permit stub/receipt
25 deemed acceptable to the Department, whenever the employee must retain the permit
26 in order to receive parking benefits) by indicating his/her signature and payroll

1 number on the portion of his/her monthly parking permit he/she receives from the
2 vendor and submit the endorsed permit (or acceptable permit stub/receipt) to the
3 Police Department Administration no later than the 15th day of the calendar month
4 covered by the monthly permit (i.e., the 15th of April for the month of April).
5 Following the Department's receipt of the endorsed permit (or acceptable permit
6 stub/receipt), the employee shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of the current
7 parking rate at the time of reimbursement.
8 Payments provided hereunder shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the
9 close of the calendar month covered by the permit. Except as provided in subsection 3,
10 below, only approved parking facilities' monthly parking permits that are properly endorsed
11 shall be covered by the benefits provided herein. 3.	The	Association
12 recognizes that there are a limited number of parking spaces available at City approved
13 parking facilities; accordingly, monthly parking permits for these spaces will be sold to
14 eligible employees on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to their availability. During a
15 calendar month when no monthly parking permit at any City-approved parking facility(ies)
16 is(are) available because the vendor(s) has(have) determined that no space is available, the
17 City will honor monthly parking permit receipts from parking facilities not on the City-
18 approved list that are within the geographic area bounded by	Michigan Avenue on the
19 south, North 12th Street on the west, West Juneau Avenue on the north and North Van
20 Buren Street on the east.	The employee shall endorse the receipt by indicating his/her
21 signature and payroll number on the monthly parking permit receipt and shall submit the
22 endorsed parking permit receipt to the Police Department Administration no later than the
23 15th day of the calendar month covered by the monthly permit (i.e., the 15th of April for the
24 month of April).	Following submission of the parking permit receipt to the Police
25 Department Administration, the employee shall be entitled to receive a monthly parking
26 benefit for the month covered by the parking permit under the same terms and conditions
27 provided in paragraph 2, above.

1 4.	Daily Parking Receipts
2 During a calendar month when no monthly parking permit is available to an employee under
3 the provisions of either paragraph 2 or 3, hereof, because no space is available, the City will
4 honor daily parking receipts from parking facilities within the geographic area described in
5 paragraph 3, hereof, subject to the employee submitting a form prescribed by the
6 Department to the Police Department Administration within five consecutive calendar days
7 following the close of the calendar month.	The form shall contain the following
8 information:
9 a.	The employee's name, signature, and payroll number;
10 b.	A listing of each individual daily parking receipt for the calendar month indicating
11 the date and amount arranged in date order with a total amount ("total amount") for
12 the calendar month plainly indicated; and
13 c.	All of the daily receipts for the calendar month stapled to the back of the form.
14 Following submission of the prescribed Departmental form to the Police Department
15 Administration, the employee shall be entitled to receive a monthly parking benefit for the
16 calendar month covered by the daily parking receipts. Such benefit shall be in lieu of the
17 monthly parking benefits provided under paragraphs 2 and 3.
18 5.	No employee shall be eligible for the parking benefits provided by the Parking During Court
19 Overtime Appearance paragraph of this Agreement for a calendar month for which he/she
20 receives benefits hereunder.
21 6.	The benefits provided hereunder are intended to be used by an employee only for the
22 purpose of commuting to and from his/her Departmental work location in connection with
23 his/her City employment. The use of a parking permit by an employee for any other purpose
24 during a calendar month shall disqualify the employee from the benefits provided hereunder
25 for that calendar month.
26 7.	Payments made under the provisions of this Article shall not be construed as being part of
27 employees' base pay and shall not be included in the computation of any fringe benefits

1 enumerated in this Agreement. Any payment made under the provisions of this Article shall
2 not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall such payments be included in any
3 computation establishing pension benefits or payments.
4 8.	The City shall be held harmless against any and all claims, actions and lawsuits relating to
5 theft or personal property damage brought against the City by employees using parking
6 facilities pursuant to the parking allowance benefits provided herein. The City shall be held
7 harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, actions, damages and judgments due to the
8 employee's operation of his or her private vehicle at parking facilities which are subject to
9 the parking allowance benefits provided herein. Nothing herein would operate to relieve the
10 City of any liability it may have arising from its actions or omissions or preclude the
11 employee from pursuing any rights or claims he/she may have under Wisconsin State Statute 12	895.46.

14 DRUG TESTING
15 MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT DRUG TESTING POLICY STATEMENT
16 The Milwaukee Police Department is charged with enforcing all laws and ordinances and
17 with maintaining a safe and peaceful community. The pervasive risk of harm caused by
18 drug trafficking and illegal drug use by members of the Police Department creates a clear
19 and present danger to the safety of the public and fellow law enforcement officers. The
20 illegal use of drugs cannot and will not be tolerated within the Milwaukee Police
21 Department. The law enforcement profession has several uniquely compelling interests that
22 justify the use of employee drug testing. The public has the right to expect that those who
23 are sworn to protect them are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to assume
24 these duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of controlled substances
25 and other forms of drug abuse can seriously impair an employee's physical and mental
26 health, and thus, job performance. Where law enforcement officers participate in illegal

1 drug use and drug activity, the integrity of the law enforcement profession and public
2 confidence in that integrity is destroyed. This confidence is further eroded by the potential
3 for corruption created by drug use.
4 Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the Milwaukee Police Department and to
5 preserve public trust and confidence in a fit and drug free law enforcement profession, the
6 Department shall implement an expanded drug testing program to detect illegal drug use by
7 sworn employees. Officers of all ranks will be randomly tested in such numbers as to ensure
8 that a credible deterrent exists to illegal drug use.
9 MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT DRUG TESTING PROGRAM
10 (Provisions applicable to MPA-represented Department Members)
11 I.	DRUG TESTING PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
12 A.	The term "Department" as used herein shall mean the Milwaukee Police Department.
13 The term "member" shall mean a Department employee in the WERC - certified
14 Department bargaining unit represented by the MPA.
15 B.	Members shall be subject to drug testing under the following circumstances:
16 1.	Where facts or circumstances are sufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion
17 that a Department member is illegally using drugs.
18 NOTE	Reasonable Suspicion exists when evidence or information which
19 appears reliable is known to the police supervisor and is of such weight and
20 persuasiveness as to make the supervisor, based upon/his/her personal
21 judgment and experience, reasonably suspect that member of the department is
22 illegally using drugs. A reasonable suspicion that a member is illegally using
23 drugs must be supported by specific articulable facts from which rational
24 inference may be drawn.   Reasonable suspicion cannot be based upon mere
25 "hunch" or solely upon poor work performance. If suspicion of drug use is
26 based upon observation of the suspected member's physical appearance, at
27 least two (2) supervisors must make observations.

1 2.	Whenever a member is directly involved in an incident that results in death, or
2 great bodily harm as defined by State Statute.
3 3.	Whenever a member is on probation, the member shall be tested prior to
4 completion of the member's probation period.	Completion of the member's
5 probation period shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.
6 4.	Whenever a member is eligible for promotion (including reclassifications), the
7 member shall be tested prior to promotion.	Promotion shall be contingent
8 upon passing the drug test.
9 5.	Whenever a member is returning from a leave of absence that exceeds 90
10 consecutive calendar days in duration. Reinstatement to the Department from
11 the leave of absence shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.
12 6.	Random Drug Testing
13 a.	Periodically a list of Department members selected for drug testing shall
14 be generated by an independent secure random selection process. The
15 frequency of random testing, and sampling rate, shall be as prescribed
16 from time to time by the Chief of Police.	The independent agency
17 providing the random selection process shall be prescribed by the Chief.
18 Such independent agency shall be provided with a list of all Department
19 members covered by random drug testing encoded so that only the Chief
20 of Police and the Commanding Officer of the Professional Performance
21 Division know the identity of the Department members.
22 b.	The Chief may increase the frequency of random testing, and sampling
23 rate over and above the frequency of random testing and sampling rate
24 he prescribes from time to time under paragraph 6.a., hereof, for
25 members assigned to the following Department Units:	Vice Control
26 Division, Tactical Enforcement Unit, Property Control Section (only
27 those persons directly involved in the custody and handling of illegal

1 drugs),	Professional Performance Division and, the Intelligence
2 Division.	If	subsequent	Departmental	reorganization	results	in
3 modifications to any of these units, the function performed by a unit as it
4 is presently constituted, shall continue to be covered hereunder no matter
5 how such unit is constituted following a future reorganization.
6 c.	Members selected to be tested shall be notified by their Commanding
7 Officer, who shall give them a written order to report for testing. A copy
8 of such written order shall not be entered into a member's personnel file,
9 but shall be retained by the Department in a file kept at the Professional
10 Performance Division.
11 d.	All members on paid leave who are selected for drug testing pursuant to
12 paragraphs 6.a. or 6.b., hereof, shall not be required to participate in such
13 test, except those members having the following status as of the notice of
14 selection:
15 (1)	Members on sick or injury leave who have received permission to
16 leave the residence to further recuperation;
17 (2)	Members on compensatory time off authorized after the selection
18 notice; or
19 (3)	Members on "suspended with pay" or "dismissed with pay pending
20 appeal" status.
21 e.	Members on regular off days shall not be subject to random drug testing.
22 f.	Any member selected for testing who claims inability to participate due
23 to medical reason shall be examined by a physician designated by the
24 Chief. The physician shall determine if such member may be excused
25 from the test. If such member is excused from a scheduled test, he/she
26 shall be rescheduled for testing as soon as possible, irrespective of any
27 random sampling selection.

1 7.	Members having sensitive assignments, referenced in paragraph 6.b., hereof,
2 shall be subject to drug testing upon entering and leaving these assignments, as
3 well as on an annual basis while serving in such assignments.
4 C.	Refusal to submit to a drug test shall result in immediate suspension and discipline
5 up to and including dismissal from the Department. Attempts to alter or substitute a
6 test sample provided by the member being tested shall be deemed a refusal to submit
7 to a drug test. When the member appears unable to give a specimen at the time of
8 the test, testing personnel shall document the circumstances on the drug-test report
9 form. The member shall be permitted no more than three (3) hours to give a sample,
10 during which time he/she shall remain in the testing area, under observation.
11 Reasonable amounts of water may be given to the employee to encourage urination.
12 Failure to submit a sample shall be considered a refusal to submit a drug test.
13 D.	Testing Procedure
14 1.	The current testing procedure shall be continued. This procedure is currently
15 administered by Aurora Consolidated Laboratories.	Nothing herein shall
16 prohibit the Chief of Police from changing the provider of this procedure, so
17 long as the new provider is DHHS-certified and performs the procedure
18 pursuant to DHSS standards.
19 2.	Substances to be tested for include:
20 Amphetamines	Opiates
21 Canabinoids	Phencyclidine (PCP)
22 Cocaine
23 Nothing herein shall prohibit the Chief of Police from amending this list of
24 substances, so long as the added substance is one for which DHHS has adopted
25 a quantitative standard for a positive test finding for the substance; the
26 Department will notify the MPA of amendments to this list of substances.
27 3.	Split Samples
28 At the collection site, the technician shall either collect the specimen in two

1 containers or shall collect the specimen in one container and shall then split the
2 specimen into two containers. One sample (the primary sample) shall be tested
3 by the City-designated testing laboratory. The other sample (the split sample)
4 shall be stored by the testing laboratory should a verified confirmed positive
5 result from the test of the first sample.
6 If a verified, confirmed positive result is obtained from the test of the primary
7 sample, the member shall be informed that he/she has 72 hours to notify the
8 Medical Review Officer (MRO) that he/she wishes to challenge the test result
9 by means of independent testing of the split sample. The member must so
10 notify the MRO in writing within 72 hours of the member's being notified that
11 his/her test was verified confirmed positive for the presence of a drug. Upon
12 such a challenge, the split sample retained by the testing laboratory for use by
13 the member shall be forwarded by the testing laboratory to a DHHS-certified
14 laboratory selected by the member from a list of four such laboratories
15 designated by the City.
16 All costs associated with the testing of the split sample shall be borne by
17 the member, provided however, if the test of the split sample does not indicate
18 a positive drug test result, then the Department shall reimburse such member
19 for the costs of testing the split sample.	Testing of split samples shall be
20 conducted pursuant to the retesting provision described in the Federal
21 Guidelines.
22 4.	All test results shall be reviewed and interpreted by a Medical Review Officer
23 (MRO) who shall be a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse
24 disorders, designated by the Chief.	The MRO shall examine alternative
25 medical explanations for any confirmed positive test result. This action may
26 include conducting a medical interview with the individual, review of the
27 individual's medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical

1 factors.	The MRO shall review all medical records made available by the
2 tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have resulted from
3 legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall forward the results of his/her
4 review to Chief of Police and/or Commanding Officer of the Professional
5 Performance Division.
6 II.	ACCESS TO TEST RESULTS
7 Confirmed positive drug test results verified by the MRO shall be made available only to the
8 following:
9 Chief of Police
10 Commanding Officer of the Professional Performance Division
11 III. ADMINISTRATION/DISCIPLINARY ACTION
12 A.	A member, who has been ordered to take and has taken, a drug test based on either
13 reasonable suspicion, or the requirements of paragraph I.B.2., hereof, shall not be
14 subject to disciplinary action until the test results are received by the Department.
15 During that period, however, the member may be required to surrender his/her
16 weapon, badge, I.D. card, cap shield, and callbox key, and may be suspended with
17 pay.	This action shall be accomplished most discreetly and, whenever possible,
18 without advising other personnel of the reasons.
19 B.	All discipline involving a member who has a confirmed positive test for illegal drug
20 use, verified by the MRO, shall be administered by the Chief; such discipline may
21 include dismissal from the Department. A challenge to a confirmed positive test
22 result by a member shall not affect or delay the effective date of discipline imposed
23 against the member pursuant to this section. The Department's position is that any
24 member proven to  have  illegally used drugs  should  be dismissed for such use,
25 subject only to the discretion of the Chief and review of the Fire and Police
26 Commission.
27 IV. EXCLUSION OF TEST RESULTS FROM CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

1	Drug test results obtained through the Milwaukee Police Department Drug Testing Program
2	may not be used as evidence against an officer in a criminal nor in a municipal ordinance
3 violation proceeding.
4 V. CONFIDENTIALITY
5 A.	Except as provided in paragraph V.B., below, there shall be no dissemination of an
6 individual member's drug test results (including documentation or information
7 contained therein) to the public.
8 B.	The provisions of paragraph V.A., hereof, shall not apply to an individual member's
9 drug test results in the following circumstances:
10 (1)	Disciplinary hearings, or appeals therefrom, occasioned by such individual
11 member's drug test results.

3 b.	Prorated Certification Pay shall be calculated as of the effective date the employee
4 separated from active service with the Department and began his/her unpaid military
5 leave of absence.
6 c.	For purposes of prorating Certification Pay benefits, an employee on the Police
7 Department payroll for at least 14 days in a calendar month shall be deemed as
8 having been on the payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is

23 (EIP) for the Milwaukee Police Department. 24
25	2.	The City formed an EIP Advisory Group prior to implementation of the EIP. The EIP

1 Advisory Group included one representative from the MPA, MPSO, and ALEASP. The
2 Chief also appointed representatives to the Advisory Group.	The purpose of the EIP
3 Advisory Group was to consider appropriate performance measurements and benchmarks
4 for the identification of employees whose performance indicates a need for intervention.
5 The   EIP   Advisory   Group   may make   recommendations   concerning   performance
6 measurements	and	intervention	benchmarks	to	the	Chief.	However,	such
7 recommendations shall be advisory only. The Chief shall give due consideration to any
8 such	recommendations.	The	Chief	shall	decide	when	the	Advisory	Group
 9 recommendations are due. 10
11 3.	The EIP is a management tool designed for multiple purposes, including, but not limited
12 to, evaluation of employees, identification of training or re-training needs and for referral
13 to the City of Milwaukee Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or to another outside
14 confidential counseling service. 15
16 a.	If an employee is identified through any EIP analysis, the mere fact that he or she
17 was identified by the EIP shall not be used in the employee's evaluation;
18 however, the data which led to the employee being identified by the EIP may be
19 used in the employee's evaluation. 20
21 b.	If the EIP analysis indicates a need for training or re-training, the employee shall
22 be required to participate in all training or re-training deemed appropriate by the
23 Chief.
24
25 c.	An employee who is referred to the EAP or to an outside confidential
26 counseling service shall not be required to participate in the EAP or other
27 counseling service. 28
29 d.	The failure of an employee to participate in the EAP or in outside confidential
30 counseling services shall not be grounds for discipline. 31
32 e.	The identity and  the nature of any outside counseling entities to which an
33 employee is referred shall not be noted on the employee's evaluation. 34
35	4.	The mere identification of an employee through any EIP analysis shall not be used for

1 disciplinary purposes; however, the data which led to the employee being identified
2 through EIP analysis may be or become the basis for discipline. 3
4 5.	Neither the Chief, the Fire and Police Commission (FPC), nor any agent of the City shall
5 be allowed to request any information from an outside counseling entity to which an
6 employee is referred. 7
8 6.	The Chief, the FPC and the City agree to treat the EIP database and the results of any
9 employee's EIP analysis, including whether an employee has exceeded or not exceeded
10 benchmarks or whether an employee has been referred to counseling, as confidential as
11 required by law. 12
13 7.	The provisions of this Article apply only to the EIP and shall not affect other
14 departmental policies, procedures or contractual agreements. 15

14 "(1)	If an employee's compensatory time off balance (CTB), including any remaining
15 unused compensatory time off earned prior to September 11, 1983, recorded on
16 the most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is less than 32 hours,
17 the employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of cash for each
18 instance of overtime work performed after issuance of the most current Status
19 Report until issuance of the next Status Report which indicates the employee's
20 CTB is equal to or greater than 32 hours."
21 The parties further agree that with respect to authorized overtime assignments directly
22 related to the Milwaukee Police Department Band function, the following provisions shall be
23 applicable:
24 1. Notwithstanding the OVERTIME Article of the 1983-1984 Labor Contract
25 between the City of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Police Association, when an
26 employee is a member of the Milwaukee Police Department Band and performs
27 an authorized overtime assignment directly related to the Band function, he/she
28 shall be compensated at base salary rates (IX) in compensatory time off for the
29 duration of such overtime assignment. The time off so earned: Shall not count

1 towards the 32-hour Compensatory Time Off Bank (CTB) limit determining the
2 employee's eligibility for overtime compensation in compensatory time off,
3 instead of cash, that is provided for in subsection 3.c.(1) of the OVERTIME
4 Article; Shall not affect the employee's CTB recorded on Police Department
5 Personnel Status Reports; and shall not be included in the cash buyout provided
6 for under subsection 3.d.(1) of the OVERTIME Article.
7 2. An employee may use earned time off from authorized overtime assignments
8 directly related to the Police Band function on dates he/she has requested
9 provided the employee gives his/her commanding officer reasonable advance
10 notice of the dates requested and the dates are determined available by the
11 commanding officer in accordance with the needs of the Police Service. The
12 processing of requests for use of compensatory time off shall be on a first-come,
13 first-served basis. Decisions made by employee's commanding officer with
14 respect to the availability of the dates the employee has requested shall be final.
15 3. Administration of Band Overtime shall be in accordance with Departmental Order
16 #7386, dated February 17, 1977, and attached herewith as Appendix A.
17 The parties further agree that for purposes of administering the benefits provided by
18 aforesaid OVERTIME Article (as amended, above) the following provisions shall apply:
19 1. Except as provided in subsection 2, of this paragraph, below, the Police Department
20 Personnel Status Report used to determine an employee's eligibility to elect compensatory
21 time off instead of cash for an instance of overtime work performed shall cover overtime
22 work performed during the 336 consecutive hour time period beginning at 12:01 a.m. on
23 the second Wednesday of the pay period closest to the date on which the Status Report is
24 issued. Normally, the Status Report would be issued on the second Wednesday of the pay
25 period; in the event the Status Report is delayed, it shall be deemed effective retroactive
26 to 12:01 a.m. on that Wednesday.

1 2. An employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of cash for rollcall overtime
2 if either of the two Police Department Personnel Status Reports that are issued during the
3 current pay period reflect a balance of less than 32 hours. Such election must be for all
4 rollcall overtime earned in such pay period.
5 3. An employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of cash for out-of-shift
6 premium earned if the employee's CTB recorded on the most current Police Department
7 Personnel Status Report in effect on the date that the out-of-shift assignment ends is less
8 than 32 hours.
9 The parties further agree that all other terms and conditions of the aforesaid OVERTIME
10 Article (as amended, above) shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
11 The parties further agree that the agreements provided for above shall be deemed to be in
12 force and effect on September 11, 1983. 13

10 The parties hereto agree that for purposes of interpretation and construction of the
11 provisions of subsection 3.c. of the OVERTIME Article of the current City/MPA labor contract,
12 in respect to administration of negative compensatory time off balances, the following shall
13 apply from and after December 19, 1983:
14 1.	Subject to the requirements governing usage of compensatory time off provided
15 for in subsection 3.c.(2) of such OVERTIME Article, an employee may use
16 compensatory time off so long as his/her compensatory time off balance (CTB)
17 recorded on the most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is not
18 less than zero (0) hours, notwithstanding the fact that such usage may result in the
19 employee having a negative CTB on the next following status report.
20 2.	An employee with a negative CTB recorded on the most current Police
21 Department Personnel Status Report shall have an amount equal to the cash value
22 of his/her negative CTB deducted from the paycheck he/she receives for the Pay
23 Period next following the Pay Period of the status report recording such negative
24 CTB. The cash value of an employee's negative CTB shall be computed on the
25 basis of his/her hourly base pay rate in effect during the Pay Period in which such
26 negative CTB occurs as this rate is established under the BASE SALARY Article
27 of the City/MPA Labor Contract in effect at that time.
28 3.	An employee may not use time off which he/she has earned, such as vacation and
29 holiday time or compensatory time off earned following publication of a Police

1 Department Personnel Status Report indicating a negative CTB for the employee,
2 to offset a negative CTB and thereby avoid the paycheck deduction provided for
3 in subsection 2, above.
4 4.	In disputes over an employee's negative CTB, the compensatory time off taken
5 and earned that is indicated on his/her time card (in the case of compensatory time
6 off earned other than for roll-call, the time off earned indicated on the employee's
7 overtime Tab Card-Form PO-7) for the Pay Period of the Police Department
8 Personnel Status Report on which the disputed negative CTB was recorded, shall
9 decide the dispute.
10 The parties further agree that all other terms and conditions of such OVERTIME Article
11 shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect. 12

11 The parties hereto agree that whenever the Police Department Personnel Status Report for

12 a pay period indicates a deficit in the time off entitlement of an employee because he/she has:

13 (1)	Exceeded his/her annual HOLIDAY OFF entitlement; and/or
14 (2)	Exceeded his/her annual VACATION entitlement; and/or
15 (3)	Exceeded his/her INJURY PAY entitlement; and/or
16 (4)	A negative SICK LEAVE BALANCE,

17 the Police Department Administration shall deduct unused time off in the employee's accounts
18 indicated on such status report that are not in deficit by an amount of time off up to the time off
19 that offsets, hour for hour, the employee's time off deficit unless the employee notifies the Police
20 Department Administration prior to 3 p.m. on the Friday immediately following the date such
21 status report is issued that he/she does not want the offset made; such notification shall be
22 provided in accordance with Departmental procedures established for this purpose.	If such
23 notification is provided the offset will not be made and the deficit will be docked from the
24 employee's paycheck for the pay period of the status report (the amount of such deficit to be
25 computed on the basis of the employee's hourly base salary rate in effect during such pay
26 period). If there is no unused time off in the employee's accounts indicated on such status report
27 that are not in deficit, or if the amount of such unused time off is insufficient to offset the
28 employee's time off deficit, the remaining deficit will be docked from the employee's paycheck
29 on the same basis as is provided above when the notification requirements are met; and

1 The parties further agree that this Memorandum of Understanding and its terms and
2 conditions shall not be applicable to negative compensatory time off overtime balances reflected
3 on the Police Department Personnel Status Report, such negative comp time balances shall be
4 governed by the provisions of a Memorandum of Understanding between the parties dated
5	December 15, 1983; and
6 The parties further agree that this memorandum of Understanding shall become effective
7 upon its execution; and
8 The parties further agree that this Memorandum of Understanding shall be made a part of

3 The following paragraphs from the Pension Benefits Article of the 1985-1986City/Association
4 Agreement are included for informational purposes:
5 1. Employees who are entitled to service credit during calendar years 1979 through
6 1986, inclusive, under either the Employee's Retirement System of Milwaukee or
7 Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Milwaukee pension plans, shall receive
8 such service credit at the rate of 2.5% per annum of Final Average Salary for each
9 such year or part thereof.
10 2. Whenever the ERS Act provides that a medical panel make a determination affecting
11 an employee's eligibility for benefits thereunder, a panel shall be substituted therefore
12 consisting of three (3) physicians, one physician to be designated by the Association,
13 one physician to be designated by the Employe Benefits Administrator and the third
14 physician to be selected by agreement of the other two physicians. The panel may
15 refer a member it is examining to an outside physician for examination. Decisions
16 made by the panel on matters which are properly before it shall be by majority action
17 and shall not be subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure provisions of this
18 Agreement. All costs associated with the panel, including costs of outside physicians
19 used by the panel in making its determinations, shall be provided for  by funds
20 appropriated for that purpose from the budget of the City Annuity and Pension Board.
21 3. Effective January 1, 1985, for employees in active service on or after that date and

24 survivorship benefits to $300/$600 per month, under the same terms and conditions
25 applicable to such current benefits. This increase is being granted because there is no
26 added cost, but if the experience is adverse, the benefits are to be reduced so as not to

1 increase cost. All other terms and conditions of survivorship benefits shall remain
2 unchanged.
3 4.  An employee who files an application for a duty disability retirement allowance with
4 the ERS Board on or after August 1, 1985, shall not be eligible to continue to receive
5 such allowance beyond the first of the month next following their 57th birthday; on
6 and after the first of the month next following their 57th birthday, such an employee
7 shall receive the service retirement allowance to which he/she would be entitled upon
8 normal retirement at age 57 and he/she shall have the time spent receiving such duty
9 disability retirement allowance included as creditable service for purposes of
10 determining his/her service retirement allowance. The City will hold the Association
11 harmless from claims and actions against the Association based upon this subsection
12 and any ordinance or administrative action implementing this subsection, and the
13 Association does hereby agree to tender the defense of any such claim to the City
14 forthwith.
15 5. An employee appointed to the Police Officer position classification on or after August
16 1, 1985, shall not be entitled to receive a duty disability retirement allowance for any
17 injury he/she may sustain while on duty prior to the start of field training during the
18 period of time he/she is assigned to the Police Academy for recruit training, including
19 any subsequent injury related to the injury sustained during recruit training. Such an

25 System of Milwaukee grants a disability retirement allowance to an employee

1 allowance shall become effective on the date the employee filed an
2 application for it with the Board.
3 b. If an employee, who becomes eligible to receive an ordinary disability
4 retirement allowance under the provisions of Section 36.05(2) of the ERS Act
5 on or after January 1, 1985, elects an optional benefit provided for under
6 36.05(7)(b) of the ERS Act, the option so elected shall become effective on
7 the employee's effective date of ordinary disability retirement as determined
8 under Section 36.05(2) of the ERS Act.
9 c. If an employee, who has attained the minimum service retirement age, elects
10 an optional benefit provided for under Subsection 36.05(7)(b) of the ERS Act
11 on or after January 1, 1985, the option so elected shall become effective on the

18 survivorship option for his/her spouse under Section 36.05(7)(b)4 of the ERS Act to
19 become effective upon his/her death provided the employee makes such election six
20 months prior to the date upon which he/she first attained 25 years of creditable
21 service as a "Policeman."	Such election shall be irrevocable, but shall be
22 automatically revoked in the event the surviving spouse pre-deceases the employee
23 before retirement or the surviving spouse is legally divorced from the employee
24 before retirement. If elected, the coverage under such option shall become effective
25 on the date the employee would have first attained age 52. In the event the employee
26 has not attained the aforesaid minimum normal retirement requirements, but has at
27 least 25 years of creditable service as a "Policeman," then such employee shall have

1 until six months following the execution date of this Agreement to elect such option;
2 if elected, the coverage under such option shall become effective on the date of
3 election.	The increase in benefits provided herein shall not apply to a surviving
4 spouse entitled to receive benefits under the provisions of Section 36.05(5) of the
5 ERS Act.  The term, "Policeman," shall be as defined under Section 36.02 of the ERS
6 Act. All other provisions of 36.05(7)(b)4 of the ERS Act shall remain unchanged in
7 full force and effect.

9 Wisconsin Statutes, the provisions of Section 36.13(2) of the ERS Act shall not be
10 applicable to employees appointed to City employment on or after August 1, 1985.
11 Implementation of the foregoing  paragraphs was  accomplished by amendments  to the City
12 Charter enacted prior to November 3, 1988. These amendments, together with the balance of
13 pension benefits applicable to employes' covered by this Agreement under the 1985-1986
14 City/Association Agreement, are referenced in the introductory paragraph of the Pension

8 A Wellness and Prevention Program and a Wellness and Prevention Committee shall be
9 implemented to promote the wellness and prevention of disease and illness of City employees,
10 retirees and their family members. The Wellness and Prevention Program shall include an
11 annual Health Risk Assessment (HRA) and may contain, but shall not be limited to, some or
12 all of the following components:	benefit communication, medical self-care, nurse line,
13 consumer health education, injury prevention, advanced directives, preventive medical
14 benefits, targeted at-risk intervention, high-risk intervention, disease management, condition
15 management, wellness incentive or other components agreed upon by the City and the unions.
16 The City shall retain a consultant to assist in developing a plan for a comprehensive
17 wellness and prevention program for the City and to assist in making program adjustments.
18 A Wellness and Prevention Committee shall be established to assist the consultant in the
19 design of the Wellness and Prevention Program and to provide oversight of the program. The
20 Wellness and Prevention Committee shall be comprised of nine union members appointed by

10	Re: Discretionary Days Off in Lieu of Discipline
11
12
13 Overview
14 The current disciplinary system within the Milwaukee Police Department frequently results in
15 varying periods of unpaid suspension leave for employees.	In essence employees are found
16 guilty of violations of departmental rules and regulations and the Chief of Police Head makes a
17 determination as to appropriate penalty. Upon Order of the Chief of Police, employees may be
18 subjected to periods of unpaid suspension of one or more days in length. In such events the
19 disciplined member is suspended for specific date(s) as determined by the Professional
20 Performance Division, and said member suffers a financial loss for the unpaid date(s).	It is
21 recognized that financial losses are not typically borne by the offending member alone, but by
22 his or her family as well. Additionally, members on paid suspension periods are absent from
23 duty and therefore the Police Department suffers the loss of human resources. It is the intent of
24 this agreement to provide for a suitable alternative to the current system, which will alleviate
25 much of the financial loss to employees and their families, keep productive employees at their
26 workplaces and still provide an effective means of discipline.   This shall be accomplished by
27 allowing Police Department members, under the below conditions, to substitute discretionary off
28 time in place of suspension days. 29
30 Procedure
31 In those discipline cases wherein the Chief of Police orders the suspension of a member for a
32 period of five days or less, the member subject to said discipline shall be served with the
33 discipline order(s) consistent with current practices. In addition, the member shall also be served
34 with a notice informing them of their option to substitute discretionary time in place of any or all
35 suspension days.	The notice shall advise the member that if he or she wishes to substitute

1 discretionary time, he or she must notify the Personnel Division in writing within five calendar
2 days. Upon proper notification, the Personnel Division shall process the member's request and
3 subtract the appropriate discretionary time from the member's balance.	Failure to properly
4 notify the Personnel Division or Administrator within the five-day period shall automatically
5 result in the member forfeiting their ability to substitute discretionary time and the suspension
6 shall proceed as ordered by the Chief. 7
8 Conditions of Agreement
9 *	For applicable suspension as described above, the substitution of discretionary time shall
10 be at the member's sole discretion, given that the member has the time available.
11 *	Suspensions exceeding five days shall not be eligible for substitution.
12 *	Only vacation days may be substituted. Substitutions shall be on a one-for-one basis, i.e.
13 one vacation day replaces one suspension day.
14 *	Compensatory time, sick time, etc., may not be utilized for substitution.
15 *	Members may choose to substitute discretionary time for all or part of a suspension
16 period. However, substitutions may only be made in full eight-hour blocks.
17 *	Members may only substitute discretionary time that is available on the current Time
18 Owed and Allowed reports. Members may not "borrow" future time.
19 *	In the event that a member chooses not to substitute discretionary time, or does not have
20 the time available to them on the current Time Owed and Allowed report, said member
21 shall serve the suspension days as ordered by the Chief.
22 *	A member's decision to substitute discretionary time shall have no bearing on their
23 disciplinary record.	All official Police Department disciplinary records, including the
24 Personnel Order, shall continue to indicate that the member was suspended for the time
25 period as ordered. Substituted suspension time shall continue to be a factor in matters
26 such as progressive discipline, Sick Leave Incentive, promotional exams, etc.
27 *	A member's decision to substitute discretionary time is neither an admission of guilt nor
28 a waiver of grievance/appeal rights.
29 *	In the event that a member chooses to substitute discretionary time and then is awarded a
30 reduction of discipline through the grievance/appeal process, said member shall be
31 credited with the awarded day(s), to the same account from which they were drawn.
32 Time credited to the member's balance shall be governed by the rules in place for
33 discretionary time applicable to the date the time is returned. For example: In January of
34 2005, a member is suspended for two days and substitutes two vacation days.	The
35 member grieves the discipline and in January of 2006, an arbitrator reduces the discipline

1 to one day. The Police Department would then add eight hours to the member's vacation
2 balance for year 2006 and subsequently the eight hours would have to be utilized by the
3 end of that calendar year, unless the arbitrator/umpire directs otherwise.
4 *	For purposes of this memorandum of understanding, the parties recognize the authority of
5 the arbitrator/umpire to direct that the member be able to utilize any returned time during
6 a period of one year immediately following the date of the award.
7 *	The Chief of Police shall not in any way consider a member's discretionary off-time
8 balance when deciding upon discipline.
9 *	The procedure would be implemented on a trial basis for the term of the 2007-2009
10 Agreement and could be extended beyond that date by mutual agreement. 11
