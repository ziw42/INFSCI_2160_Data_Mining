# DM-hw04-starter

This contains the starter code for assignment hw04 (data and sample code included). You should extend `hw04-template.Rmd` with your answers into `hw04.Rmd` and `hw04.html` and commit the two files to your own assignment repository. Finally, follow the homework how-to guide to publish your RMarkdown note and enter the perview-able URL in the Canvas assignment entry.
